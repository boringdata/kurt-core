# ADD-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md

## When to use this instruction
To modify the base project plan template (@kurt/templates/plan-template.md) that is used for all new projects.

**IMPORTANT: Confirmation Required**
Before modifying the base plan template, confirm with the user:
- What changes they want to make
- Whether this change should apply to all projects (base template) or just a specific project (modify that project's plan.md directly)

## Steps to execute

1. **Confirm the change** with the user:
   - Load @kurt/templates/plan-template.md (the <base_plan_template>)
   - Show the user the current structure
   - Ask: "What would you like to change? This will affect all new projects created going forward."

2. **Make the modifications**:
   - Update the <base_plan_template> with the requested changes
   - Preserve existing structure unless explicitly asked to change it
   - Maintain placeholders ({{PLACEHOLDER_NAME}}) for dynamic content

3. **Explain what changed**:
   - Summarize the modifications made
   - Explain how this affects new projects
   - Note: Existing projects are not affected (they have their own plan.md files)

4. **Confirm with user**:
   - Show a diff or summary of changes
   - Ask: "Does this look correct? Should I save these changes?"

5. **Save the template**:
   - Write the updated template to @kurt/templates/plan-template.md
   - Confirm: "Base plan template updated. All new projects will use this structure."

## Notes

- **Existing projects**: Modifying the base template does NOT affect existing projects. Each project has its own `plan.md` file.
- **User-specific customizations**: If the user wants project-specific structure, they should modify that project's `plan.md` directly, not the base template.
- **Format templates**: The base plan template works with all format templates. Don't add format-specific sections unless they apply universally.
