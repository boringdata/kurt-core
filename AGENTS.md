# AGENTS.md

Read this first. Re-read after compaction.

## Safety (non-negotiable)

- No destructive ops without explicit instruction (no `rm -rf`, `reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, force-push).
- No secrets in git. Do not paste tokens into commits or logs.
- No broad rewrite scripts (codemods, "fix everything") without approval.
- No file variants (`*_v2.*`) — edit in place.
- Never delete files unless you have explicit written permission.

## Shared Conventions

These docs define the boring-coding workflow. Read local copy if available; fall back to GitHub.

## Session Startup

1. Read `AGENTS.md` end-to-end.
2. Read `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
3. Find how to run tests, lint, dev server (see Project Commands below).
4. Pick next bead: `bv --robot-next` or `br list --status=open`.

For full session lifecycle (compaction, blocked, end-of-session): see `docs/workflow-symlinked/OPERATIONS.md`.

## Bead Startup (per bead)

1. `br show <bead-id>` — goal, scope, gates, checklist, latest comments.
2. Find latest `EVIDENCE:` path in bead comments.
3. Inspect `.agent-evidence/beads/<bead-id>/...` for prior work.
4. Confirm STATE + NEXT match your role.

## Project Commands

- Install: `uv sync --all-extras`
- Tests: `uv run pytest -q`
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .`
- Dev server: `uv run kurt --help` (CLI tool, no persistent dev server)
- Smoke gate: `scripts/gates/smoke.sh`

## Credentials

Fetch from Vault:
- `secret/agent/boringdata-agent` (GitHub token, username, email)

Never commit secrets. Use env vars or `.env` (gitignored).
