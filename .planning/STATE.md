## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: SKILL.md format matches OpenClaw pattern (YAML frontmatter + Markdown)
- [Roadmap]: Function-based skills via @skill decorator preferred over class-based
- [Roadmap]: Async-first interfaces enforced (research: async/sync collision is critical pitfall)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged: Phase 2 may need URL routing library research (urlmatch vs Routes vs regex)
- Research flagged: DISC-04 (hot reload) marked v1 but research says defer to post-MVP
