# Cloudflare R2

Object storage for all your data.

Cloudflare R2 Storage allows developers to store large amounts of unstructured data without the costly egress bandwidth fees associated with typical cloud storage services.

You can use R2 for multiple scenarios, including but not limited to:

- Storage for cloud-native applications
- Cloud storage for web content
- Storage for podcast episodes
- Data lakes (analytics and big data)
- Cloud storage output for large batch processes, such as machine learning model artifacts or datasets
