# Cloudflare D1

Create new serverless SQL databases to query from your Workers and Pages projects.

D1 is Cloudflare's managed, serverless database with SQLite's SQL semantics, built-in disaster recovery, and Worker and HTTP API access.

D1 is designed for horizontal scale out across multiple, smaller (10 GB) databases, such as per-user, per-tenant or per-entity databases. D1 allows you to build applications with thousands of databases at no extra cost for isolating with multiple databases. D1 pricing is based only on query and storage costs.

Create your first D1 database by [following the Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/get-started/), learn how to [import data into a database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/import-export-data/), and how to [interact with your database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/worker-api/) directly from [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) or [Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#d1-databases).

### Create your first D1 database

Create your first D1 database, establish a schema, import data and query D1 directly from an application [built with Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

### SQLite

Execute SQL with SQLite's SQL compatibility and D1 Client API.

### Time Travel

Time Travel is D1’s approach to backups and point-in-time-recovery, and allows you to restore a database to any minute within the last 30 days.
