# Postgres on Vercel

Vercel lets you connect external Postgres databases through the [Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace), allowing you to connect external Postgres databases to your Vercel projects without managing database servers.

- Explore
[Marketplace storage postgres integrations](https://vercel.com/marketplace?category=storage&search=postgres). - Learn how to
[add a Marketplace native integration](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration).

Vercel enables you to use Postgres by integrating with external database providers. By using the Marketplace, you can:

- Select from a
[range of Postgres providers](https://vercel.com/marketplace?category=storage&search=postgres) - Provision and configure a Postgres database with minimal setup.
- Have credentials and
[environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables)injected into your Vercel project.
