The `kurt answer` command uses an LLM to generate answers from the indexed content, which requires API credentials.\n\n**Error:** The command needs an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.\n\nTo resolve this, you would need to either:\n1. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the command\n2. Configure the API key in the kurt configuration file\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Check the current kurt configuration to see how API keys are managed?\n- Show you how to set up the API key for the answer command?",
