# Question Result: ...How do I set up MotherDuck to work with dbt?

**Answer File**: /tmp/answer_with_kg_5.md

## Answer
To set up MotherDuck to work with dbt, configure a connection profile in dbt that specifies MotherDuck as the data warehouse. This involves setting the database type, host, port, and user credentials in dbt's configuration files. Since MotherDuck is powered by DuckDB, it should support standard SQL connection protocols compatible with dbt.

## Reasoning

To set up MotherDuck to work with dbt, we need to consider the integration capabilities of MotherDuck, which is powered by DuckDB. MotherDuck provides a managed service that works seamlessly with the DuckDB Python client, which suggests that it can be integrated with dbt, a data transformation tool that uses SQL. The key steps would involve configuring dbt to connect to MotherDuck as a data warehouse. This typically involves setting up a connection profile in dbt that specifies the database type, host, port, user credentials, and any other necessary parameters. Since MotherDuck is a cloud data warehouse, it likely supports standard connection protocols that dbt can utilize. The documents provided do not explicitly detail the setup process with dbt, but given the integration with DuckDB and the nature of dbt's compatibility with SQL-based systems, the setup should be straightforward.

**Feedback**:
The generated answer is mostly accurate but misses key details about the dbt-duckdb adapter and the necessity of including a token in the configuration. While it addresses the question and is clear, it does not fully cover the required setup steps, leading to a lower completeness score. Overall, it provides a good starting point but lacks essential specifics for a complete setup.
