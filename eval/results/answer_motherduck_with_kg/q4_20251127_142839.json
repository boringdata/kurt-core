    "feedback": "The generated answer is mostly accurate and relevant, addressing some of the reasons for slower performance on MotherDuck. However, it lacks completeness as it does not cover all the key factors mentioned in the canonical answer, such as data transfer overhead and cold start times. The clarity of the response is good, making it easy to understand."
