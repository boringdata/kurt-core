  "question": "...If I have a CSV on my laptop and a table in S3, what's the most efficient way to join them using MotherDuck?",
  "answer": "The most efficient way to join a CSV on your laptop with a table in S3 using MotherDuck is to use DuckDB. You can load the CSV into DuckDB and perform a SQL join with the S3 table directly. DuckDB's capability to query data from S3 without downloading it locally makes this process efficient.",

    "feedback": "The generated answer is mostly accurate and relevant, as it correctly identifies DuckDB as a tool for joining the CSV and S3 table. However, it lacks completeness because it does not cover the specific features of MotherDuck mentioned in the canonical answer, such as creating a temporary table and minimizing data movement. Overall, the clarity of the response is good, making it easy to understand."
