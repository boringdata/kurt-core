### Command: question:q1

```
The most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck are Parquet and ORC, as they are optimized for analytical queries and are well-suited for use with DuckDB.

## Reasoning

To determine the most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck, we need to consider the architecture and capabilities of MotherDuck, which is based on DuckDB. DuckDB is known for its efficient handling of columnar data formats, which are typically used in data lakehouses and data warehouses. The entities and relationships suggest a focus on modern data architectures like data lakehouses, which often utilize columnar storage formats such as Parquet and ORC for their efficiency in both storage and query performance.

The document titled "data-lake-vs-data-warehouse-vs-lakehouse" likely discusses the advantages of different storage formats in these architectures. Additionally, the "duckdb-ecosystem-newsletter-february-2025" might provide insights into the latest developments and best practices for using DuckDB, which would include preferred file formats.

Given this context, Parquet and ORC are likely the most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck, as they are optimized for analytical queries and are commonly used in environments that leverage DuckDB.
