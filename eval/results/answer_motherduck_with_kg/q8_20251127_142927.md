# Question Result: ...What's the difference between a MotherDuck database and a share?

**Answer File**: /tmp/answer_with_kg_8.md

## Answer
A MotherDuck database is a cloud data warehouse solution powered by DuckDB, designed to scale analytical queries to the cloud. In contrast, a "share" typically refers to a feature within a data warehousing system that allows data or resources to be shared between users or systems. Thus, MotherDuck is a specific product, while a share is a functionality that might be part of such a system.
