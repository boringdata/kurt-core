# Answer

To migrate data from a local DuckDB database to MotherDuck, export your data into Parquet format, upload it to a cloud storage service like S3, and then use MotherDuck to ingest the data from there. This process leverages the integration between DuckDB and MotherDuck, allowing for efficient data migration and scaling.
