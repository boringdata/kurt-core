# Answer

The most efficient way to join a CSV on your laptop with a table in S3 using MotherDuck is to use DuckDB. You can load the CSV into DuckDB and perform a SQL join with the S3 table directly. DuckDB's capability to query data from S3 without downloading it locally makes this process efficient.
