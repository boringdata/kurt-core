  "question": "...What SQL features from DuckDB are not yet supported in MotherDuck?",
  "answer": "The specific SQL features from DuckDB that are not yet supported in MotherDuck are not detailed in the provided information. It is likely that any limitations would be related to the cloud integration or specific optimizations for MotherDuck's environment.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nTo determine which SQL features from DuckDB are not yet supported in MotherDuck, we need to analyze the integration and capabilities of both systems. DuckDB is an embedded database management system designed for fast analytical queries, and it powers MotherDuck, a cloud data warehouse. The relationship between DuckDB and MotherDuck suggests that MotherDuck leverages DuckDB's capabilities to scale to the cloud. However, the specific SQL features that might be missing in MotherDuck compared to DuckDB are not explicitly detailed in the provided documents or relationships.\n\nGiven the lack of direct information on unsupported SQL features in MotherDuck, we can infer that any limitations would likely stem from the cloud integration or specific optimizations for cloud environments that might not yet fully replicate all of DuckDB's standalone features. The documents and relationships focus more on the integration and benefits of using DuckDB within MotherDuck rather than detailing specific unsupported features.",

    "feedback": "The generated answer lacks specific details about the unsupported SQL features in MotherDuck, which is the core of the question. While it touches on relevant topics like cloud integration, it does not provide a clear or complete response, leading to lower scores in accuracy and completeness. The clarity is moderate, but the lack of direct information diminishes its overall effectiveness."
