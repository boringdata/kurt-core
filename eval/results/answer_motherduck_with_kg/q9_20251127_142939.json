    "feedback": "The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the serverless nature of MotherDuck's compute service, but it fails to provide specific details about instance sizes, which are crucial for completeness. While the clarity is good, the lack of comprehensive information affects the overall effectiveness of the response."
