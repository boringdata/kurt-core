# Answer

The specific compute instance sizes offered by MotherDuck are not detailed in the provided context. For precise information, it would be best to consult MotherDuck's official documentation or contact their support team.

## Reasoning

To determine the compute instance sizes offered by MotherDuck, we need to examine the provided entities, relationships, and documents. The entities list includes MotherDuck, which is a cloud data warehouse powered by DuckDB. However, there is no direct mention of specific compute instance sizes in the entities or relationships. The documents provided are relevant to understanding MotherDuck's offerings and its integration with DuckDB, but they do not explicitly list the compute instance sizes. Given the lack of specific information in the provided context, it is likely that the details about compute instance sizes are either not publicly detailed in the documents or require access to specific product documentation or a direct inquiry with MotherDuck.
