# Question Result: ...... What file formats are most efficient for loading data into MotherDuck?

**Answer File**: /tmp/answer_with_kg_1.md

## Answer
The most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck are Parquet and ORC, as they are optimized for analytical queries and are well-suited for use with DuckDB.

## Reasoning

To determine the most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck, we need to consider the architecture and capabilities of MotherDuck, which is based on DuckDB. DuckDB is known for its efficient handling of columnar data formats, which are typically used in data lakehouses and data warehouses. The entities and relationships suggest a focus on modern data architectures like data lakehouses, which often utilize columnar storage formats such as Parquet and ORC for their efficiency in both storage and query performance.

The document titled "data-lake-vs-data-warehouse-vs-lakehouse" likely discusses the advantages of different storage formats in these architectures. Additionally, the "duckdb-ecosystem-newsletter-february-2025" might provide insights into the latest developments and best practices for using DuckDB, which would include preferred file formats.

Given this context, Parquet and ORC are likely the most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck, as they are optimized for analytical queries and are commonly used in environments that leverage DuckDB.

**Feedback**:
The generated answer is mostly accurate, correctly identifying Parquet as the most efficient format, but it introduces ORC, which is not mentioned in the canonical answer. The completeness score is slightly lower due to the introduction of an additional format that wasn't required. The answer is relevant and clear, but it could be improved by focusing solely on the canonical answer's content.
