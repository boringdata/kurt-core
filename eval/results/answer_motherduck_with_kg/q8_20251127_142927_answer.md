# Answer

A MotherDuck database is a cloud data warehouse solution powered by DuckDB, designed to scale analytical queries to the cloud. In contrast, a "share" typically refers to a feature within a data warehousing system that allows data or resources to be shared between users or systems. Thus, MotherDuck is a specific product, while a share is a functionality that might be part of such a system.
