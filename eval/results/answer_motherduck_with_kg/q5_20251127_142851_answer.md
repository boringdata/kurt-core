# Answer

To set up MotherDuck to work with dbt, you need to configure a connection profile in dbt that includes the necessary credentials and connection parameters for MotherDuck. This involves specifying the target database, schema, and authentication details required by MotherDuck, similar to how you would set up dbt with other cloud data warehouses.
