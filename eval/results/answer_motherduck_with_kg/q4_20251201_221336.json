  "question": "...Why might a query run slower on MotherDuck than locally?",
  "answer": "A query might run slower on MotherDuck than locally due to network latency and resource contention in the cloud environment, which are not factors when running queries locally with DuckDB.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nTo determine why a query might run slower on MotherDuck compared to locally, we need to consider the architecture and operational differences between local and cloud-based systems. MotherDuck is a cloud data warehouse powered by DuckDB, which allows DuckDB to scale to the cloud. This means that when queries are run on MotherDuck, they are executed in a cloud environment, which can introduce latency due to network communication and data transfer between the local environment and the cloud. Additionally, cloud-based systems often involve shared resources, which can lead to contention and variability in performance depending on the current load on the system.\n\nIn contrast, running queries locally with DuckDB means that the data and computation are handled on the same machine, eliminating network latency and allowing for more predictable performance as the resources are dedicated to the local machine. Furthermore, local execution can leverage the full power of the local machine's CPU and memory without the overhead of cloud orchestration.\n\nThe documents and relationships indicate that MotherDuck integrates with DuckDB to provide a managed service that scales to the cloud, which is beneficial for large-scale data processing but may introduce overhead for smaller or less complex queries that could be handled more efficiently locally.",
