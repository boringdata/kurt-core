  "question": "...What's the difference between a MotherDuck database and a share?",
  "answer": "A MotherDuck database is a cloud data warehouse solution powered by DuckDB, designed to scale analytical queries to the cloud. In contrast, a \"share\" typically refers to a feature within a data warehousing system that allows data or resources to be shared between users or systems. Thus, MotherDuck is a specific product, while a share is a functionality that might be part of such a system.",

    "feedback": "The generated answer is mostly accurate but misses key details from the canonical answer, particularly regarding the ownership and modification aspects of a MotherDuck database and the collaborative nature of shares. While it is clear and well-written, it does not fully address all required topics, leading to lower completeness."
