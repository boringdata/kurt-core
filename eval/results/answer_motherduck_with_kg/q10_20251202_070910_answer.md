# Answer

MotherDuck likely supports the latest stable versions of DuckDB, but specific version details are not explicitly provided in the available information.

## Reasoning

To determine which DuckDB versions MotherDuck currently supports, we need to consider the integration and relationship between MotherDuck and DuckDB. MotherDuck is a cloud data warehouse that is powered by DuckDB, allowing it to scale to the cloud. This implies that MotherDuck is designed to work with the latest stable versions of DuckDB to ensure compatibility and performance. However, the specific versions supported are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents or relationships. Typically, such platforms support the latest stable releases to leverage new features and improvements. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that MotherDuck supports the latest stable versions of DuckDB, but without explicit documentation, this remains an assumption.
