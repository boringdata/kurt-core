    "feedback": "The generated answer is mostly accurate as it identifies Parquet as an efficient format, but it introduces ORC without justification and omits other relevant formats like CSV and JSON. While the answer is clear and relevant, it lacks completeness in covering all required topics mentioned in the canonical answer."
