# Answer

MotherDuck integrates with DuckDB by using it as the core database engine, allowing DuckDB to scale to the cloud through MotherDuck's managed service. This integration supports open storage and serverless compute, enabling efficient and scalable analytical workloads.

## Reasoning

MotherDuck integrates with DuckDB by leveraging DuckDB's capabilities as an embedded database management system designed for fast analytical queries. The integration allows DuckDB to scale to the cloud through MotherDuck's infrastructure. MotherDuck provides a managed service that works seamlessly with the DuckDB Python client, enabling users to perform complex analytical workloads efficiently. The relationship between MotherDuck and DuckDB is characterized by MotherDuck being powered by DuckDB, which allows for open storage using Parquet on S3 and serverless compute. This setup facilitates a cloud data warehouse environment that is both scalable and efficient, aligning with MotherDuck's goal of providing a lean and smart data hub.
