# Answer

To migrate data from a local DuckDB database to MotherDuck, you can leverage MotherDuck's **hybrid/dual execution model**, which allows queries to execute across both local and cloud environments seamlessly.

## Migration Steps

1. **Connect to MotherDuck**: Set your `motherduck_token` environment variable for authentication, then connect using the MotherDuck connection string

2. **Attach both databases**: Use the attach functionality to connect your local DuckDB file alongside your MotherDuck cloud database

3. **Copy data using SQL**: Transfer tables using standard SQL commands like `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` or `INSERT INTO` to copy data from your local database to MotherDuck tables

## Key Benefits

- The **dual execution model minimizes data movement** and improves query performance during migration
- The **dual execution planner reduces network traffic** by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods
- MotherDuck's **hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability**
- You can analyze local files and join them with cloud data in a **unified data environment**

The hybrid architecture means you don't need to fully migrate immediately—you can work with both local and cloud data simultaneously, making the transition gradual and low-risk.
