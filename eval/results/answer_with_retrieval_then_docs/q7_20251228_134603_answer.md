# Answer

The most efficient way to join a local CSV with an S3 table in MotherDuck is to use **Dual Execution** (also called hybrid execution).

**How it works:**
1. Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB
2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file
3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck
4. Join them in a single SQL query

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data
JOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data
  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id
```

**Why this is efficient:**
- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods
- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance
- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability
- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently

The query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.
