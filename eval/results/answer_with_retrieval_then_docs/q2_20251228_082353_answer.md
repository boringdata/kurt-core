# Answer

MotherDuck integrates with DuckDB by providing a **serverless cloud analytics platform built on top of DuckDB**. The key integration features are:

1. **Hybrid Execution Model**: MotherDuck lets you analyze local data while still JOINing with data processed in the cloud. This dual execution approach allows queries to run both locally (using DuckDB's in-process engine) and in the cloud seamlessly.

2. **Native DuckDB Compatibility**: Since MotherDuck is built on DuckDB, you can use the same DuckDB SQL syntax and features. DuckDB is an in-process database you can pip install and use immediately, and MotherDuck extends this to the cloud.

3. **Tool Integrations**: Multiple tools connect to both DuckDB and MotherDuck:
   - The DuckDB/MotherDuck MCP server allows AI copilots to run queries against local DuckDB databases
   - Flyte has a DuckDB plugin with MotherDuck integration
   - PostgreSQL can integrate with DuckDB and MotherDuck to enhance analytical capabilities
   - Meltano connects to DuckDB-based data warehouses including MotherDuck

4. **Storage Efficiency**: MotherDuck provides compression benefits (one customer reported 4 TB compressing to 1 TB) while maintaining DuckDB query performance.
