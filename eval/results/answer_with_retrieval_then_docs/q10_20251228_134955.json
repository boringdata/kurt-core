        "stdout": "A query might run slower on MotherDuck than locally for these key reasons:\n\n1. **Network latency and data transfer**: When querying data that needs to be transferred between your local machine and the cloud, network overhead adds latency. The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally. Use MotherDuck when you need cloud-scale data, collaboration, or when data already resides in MotherDuck storage.\n\n---\nSources:\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude,\" \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly...computation occurs locally\"",

Data must travel over the network, which adds overhead compared to purely local execution.\n\n2. **Small data scenarios**: For small datasets, the overhead of cloud execution may exceed the actual query processing time. DuckDB operates \"in-process\" locally, which allows extremely fast execution without network round trips. The hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability\" - but for small queries, local processing is naturally faster.\n\n3. **Data movement between local and cloud**: The dual execution model \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance,\" and optimizations \"reduce the round trips needed for many Dual Execution queries from two to one.\" However, when data must move between local and cloud environments, there's still inherent overhead.\n\n4. **Query complexity and scale**: The dual execution planner \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods,\" but this benefit is most apparent at scale. For simple queries on small datasets that fit entirely in local memory, local DuckDB execution has zero network overhead and wins on pure speed.\n\n**Bottom line**: For small datasets or simple queries, local DuckDB's in-process execution eliminates all network overhead. MotherDuck shines when you need cloud scalability, larger datasets, or want to join local data with cloud data - but for small, self-contained workloads, local execution will naturally be faster.\n\n---\nSources:\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- network latency entity: \"delay in communication affecting data transfer speeds\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing quick iteration since computation occurs locally\"\n"

The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally.

              "content": "# Answer\n\nThe most efficient way to join a local CSV with an S3 table in MotherDuck is to use **Dual Execution** (also called hybrid execution).\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)\n"

Data must travel over the network, which adds overhead compared to purely local execution.\n\n2. **Small data scenarios**: For small datasets, the overhead of cloud execution may exceed the actual query processing time. DuckDB operates \"in-process\" locally, which allows extremely fast execution without network round trips. The hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability\" - but for small queries, local processing is naturally faster.\n\n3. **Data movement between local and cloud**: The dual execution model \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance,\" and optimizations \"reduce the round trips needed for many Dual Execution queries from two to one.\" However, when data must move between local and cloud environments, there's still inherent overhead.\n\n4. **Query complexity and scale**: The dual execution planner \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods,\" but this benefit is most apparent at scale. For simple queries on small datasets that fit entirely in local memory, local DuckDB execution has zero network overhead and wins on pure speed.\n\n**Bottom line**: For small datasets or simple queries, local DuckDB's in-process execution eliminates all network overhead. MotherDuck shines when you need cloud scalability, larger datasets, or want to join local data with cloud data - but for small, self-contained workloads, local execution will naturally be faster.\n\n---\nSources:\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- network latency entity: \"delay in communication affecting data transfer speeds\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing quick iteration since computation occurs locally\"\n"

The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally. Use MotherDuck when you need cloud-scale data, collaboration, or when data already resides in MotherDuck storage.\n\n---\nSources:\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude,\" \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly...computation occurs locally\"\n"

Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)\n"

Data must travel over the network, which adds overhead compared to purely local execution.\n\n2. **Small data scenarios**: For small datasets, the overhead of cloud execution may exceed the actual query processing time. DuckDB operates \"in-process\" locally, which allows extremely fast execution without network round trips. The hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability\" - but for small queries, local processing is naturally faster.\n\n3. **Data movement between local and cloud**: The dual execution model \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance,\" and optimizations \"reduce the round trips needed for many Dual Execution queries from two to one.\" However, when data must move between local and cloud environments, there's still inherent overhead.\n\n4. **Query complexity and scale**: The dual execution planner \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods,\" but this benefit is most apparent at scale. For simple queries on small datasets that fit entirely in local memory, local DuckDB execution has zero network overhead and wins on pure speed.\n\n**Bottom line**: For small datasets or simple queries, local DuckDB's in-process execution eliminates all network overhead. MotherDuck shines when you need cloud scalability, larger datasets, or want to join local data with cloud data - but for small, self-contained workloads, local execution will naturally be faster.\n\n---\nSources:\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- network latency entity: \"delay in communication affecting data transfer speeds\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing quick iteration since computation occurs locally\"\n"

The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally. Use MotherDuck when you need cloud-scale data, collaboration, or when data already resides in MotherDuck storage.\n\n---\nSources:\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude,\" \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly...computation occurs locally\"\n"

Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)\n"

Ducklings can start almost instantly, shut down when not in use, and auto-scaling operates independently for each Duckling.\n\n---\nSources:\n- Claim: \"MotherDuck has three Duckling sizes: Pulse, Standard and Jumbo\" [190306a1]\n- Claim: \"Mega and Giga instances are built for the largest, toughest, most complex data transformations\" [90c8eca1]\n- Claim: \"Giga gives DuckDB an environment with maximum compute and memory\" [900d4d8f]\n- Entities: Pulse, Standard, Jumbo, Mega Ducklings, Giga Ducklings\n"

Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)",

Data must travel over the network, which adds overhead compared to purely local execution.\n\n2. **Small data scenarios**: For small datasets, the overhead of cloud execution may exceed the actual query processing time. DuckDB operates \"in-process\" locally, which allows extremely fast execution without network round trips. The hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability\" - but for small queries, local processing is naturally faster.\n\n3. **Data movement between local and cloud**: The dual execution model \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance,\" and optimizations \"reduce the round trips needed for many Dual Execution queries from two to one.\" However, when data must move between local and cloud environments, there's still inherent overhead.\n\n4. **Query complexity and scale**: The dual execution planner \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods,\" but this benefit is most apparent at scale. For simple queries on small datasets that fit entirely in local memory, local DuckDB execution has zero network overhead and wins on pure speed.\n\n**Bottom line**: For small datasets or simple queries, local DuckDB's in-process execution eliminates all network overhead. MotherDuck shines when you need cloud scalability, larger datasets, or want to join local data with cloud data - but for small, self-contained workloads, local execution will naturally be faster.\n\n---\nSources:\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- network latency entity: \"delay in communication affecting data transfer speeds\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing quick iteration since computation occurs locally\"\n"

The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally.

              "content": "# Answer\n\nThe most efficient way to join a local CSV with an S3 table in MotherDuck is to use **Dual Execution** (also called hybrid execution).\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)\n"

DuckDB's in-process execution has zero network overhead locally\n\nThe Dual Execution model mitigates these issues by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but for small local datasets, local DuckDB will naturally be faster due to its in-process architecture."

Data must travel over the network, which adds overhead compared to purely local execution.\n\n2. **Small data scenarios**: For small datasets, the overhead of cloud execution may exceed the actual query processing time. DuckDB operates \"in-process\" locally, which allows extremely fast execution without network round trips. The hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability\" - but for small queries, local processing is naturally faster.\n\n3. **Data movement between local and cloud**: The dual execution model \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance,\" and optimizations \"reduce the round trips needed for many Dual Execution queries from two to one.\" However, when data must move between local and cloud environments, there's still inherent overhead.\n\n4. **Query complexity and scale**: The dual execution planner \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods,\" but this benefit is most apparent at scale. For simple queries on small datasets that fit entirely in local memory, local DuckDB execution has zero network overhead and wins on pure speed.\n\n**Bottom line**: For small datasets or simple queries, local DuckDB's in-process execution eliminates all network overhead. MotherDuck shines when you need cloud scalability, larger datasets, or want to join local data with cloud data - but for small, self-contained workloads, local execution will naturally be faster.\n\n---\nSources:\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- network latency entity: \"delay in communication affecting data transfer speeds\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing quick iteration since computation occurs locally\"\n"

The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally. Use MotherDuck when you need cloud-scale data, collaboration, or when data already resides in MotherDuck storage.\n\n---\nSources:\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude,\" \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly...computation occurs locally\"\n"

Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)\n"

Data must travel over the network, which adds overhead compared to purely local execution.\n\n2. **Small data scenarios**: For small datasets, the overhead of cloud execution may exceed the actual query processing time. DuckDB operates \"in-process\" locally, which allows extremely fast execution without network round trips. The hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability\" - but for small queries, local processing is naturally faster.\n\n3. **Data movement between local and cloud**: The dual execution model \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance,\" and optimizations \"reduce the round trips needed for many Dual Execution queries from two to one.\" However, when data must move between local and cloud environments, there's still inherent overhead.\n\n4. **Query complexity and scale**: The dual execution planner \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods,\" but this benefit is most apparent at scale. For simple queries on small datasets that fit entirely in local memory, local DuckDB execution has zero network overhead and wins on pure speed.\n\n**Bottom line**: For small datasets or simple queries, local DuckDB's in-process execution eliminates all network overhead. MotherDuck shines when you need cloud scalability, larger datasets, or want to join local data with cloud data - but for small, self-contained workloads, local execution will naturally be faster.\n\n---\nSources:\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- network latency entity: \"delay in communication affecting data transfer speeds\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing quick iteration since computation occurs locally\"\n"

The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally. Use MotherDuck when you need cloud-scale data, collaboration, or when data already resides in MotherDuck storage.\n\n---\nSources:\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude,\" \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly...computation occurs locally\"\n"

Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)\n"

Ducklings can start almost instantly, shut down when not in use, and auto-scaling operates independently for each Duckling.\n\n---\nSources:\n- Claim: \"MotherDuck has three Duckling sizes: Pulse, Standard and Jumbo\" [190306a1]\n- Claim: \"Mega and Giga instances are built for the largest, toughest, most complex data transformations\" [90c8eca1]\n- Claim: \"Giga gives DuckDB an environment with maximum compute and memory\" [900d4d8f]\n- Entities: Pulse, Standard, Jumbo, Mega Ducklings, Giga Ducklings\n"

Data must travel over the network, which adds overhead compared to purely local execution.\n\n2. **Small data scenarios**: For small datasets, the overhead of cloud execution may exceed the actual query processing time. DuckDB operates \"in-process\" locally, which allows extremely fast execution without network round trips. The hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability\" - but for small queries, local processing is naturally faster.\n\n3. **Data movement between local and cloud**: The dual execution model \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance,\" and optimizations \"reduce the round trips needed for many Dual Execution queries from two to one.\" However, when data must move between local and cloud environments, there's still inherent overhead.\n\n4. **Query complexity and scale**: The dual execution planner \"reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods,\" but this benefit is most apparent at scale. For simple queries on small datasets that fit entirely in local memory, local DuckDB execution has zero network overhead and wins on pure speed.\n\n**Bottom line**: For small datasets or simple queries, local DuckDB's in-process execution eliminates all network overhead. MotherDuck shines when you need cloud scalability, larger datasets, or want to join local data with cloud data - but for small, self-contained workloads, local execution will naturally be faster.\n\n---\nSources:\n- hybrid execution model: \"provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\"\n- Dual Execution model: \"minimizes data movement and improves query performance\"\n- Dual Execution: \"reduces round trips from two to one\"\n- network latency entity: \"delay in communication affecting data transfer speeds\"\n- DuckDB: \"operates in-process, allowing quick iteration since computation occurs locally\"\n"

The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.\n\n2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid execution model provides \"local processing speed with cloud scalability,\" but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.\n\n3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips \"from two to one,\" this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.\n\n4. **In-process vs. cloud**: DuckDB \"operates in-process, allowing us to iterate quickly since computation occurs locally within the same process.\" This zero-overhead local execution is hard to beat for small queries.\n\n**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on small local data, use DuckDB locally.

              "content": "# Answer\n\nThe most efficient way to join a local CSV with an S3 table in MotherDuck is to use **Dual Execution** (also called hybrid execution).\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Connect to MotherDuck from DuckDB\n2. Use `read_csv()` to reference your local CSV file\n3. Query your S3 table through MotherDuck\n4. Join them in a single SQL query\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data\nJOIN my_cloud_table AS cloud_data\n  ON local_data.id = cloud_data.id\n```\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n- The dual execution planner reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods\n- The dual execution model minimizes data movement and improves query performance\n- The hybrid execution model provides local processing speed with cloud scalability\n- DuckDB automatically detects when extensions are needed (like `httpfs` for S3 access) and loads them transparently\n\nThe query planner intelligently decides which parts run locally vs. in the cloud, and optimizations reduce round trips for many dual execution queries from two to one.\n\n---\nSources: Dual Execution, hybrid execution model, Dual Execution model, DuckDB (extension auto-loading claim)\n"
