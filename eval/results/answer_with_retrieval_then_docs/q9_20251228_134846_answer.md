# Answer

MotherDuck offers **five compute instance sizes** called "Ducklings":

1. **Pulse** - The smallest size, designed for lightweight, on-demand analytics
2. **Standard** - Designed for common data warehouse workloads
3. **Jumbo** - Built for production-scale analytics with heavy concurrent queries
4. **Mega** - For workloads that have outgrown Jumbo
5. **Giga** - The largest size, providing maximum compute and memory for the toughest, most complex data transformations

Users can choose from these instance types to match their job requirements, optimizing for either cost or performance. Ducklings can start almost instantly, shut down when not in use, and auto-scaling operates independently for each Duckling.
