# Answer

A query might run slower on MotherDuck than locally for these key reasons:

1. **Network latency and data transfer**: When querying data that needs to be transferred between your local machine and the cloud, network overhead adds latency. The Dual Execution model addresses this by minimizing data movement and reducing round trips, but queries involving significant data transfer between local and cloud will still be slower than purely local execution.

2. **Data location**: If you're analyzing large local files while joining them with cloud data, data must traverse the network. MotherDuck's hybrid analytics approach can "end slow queries" by intelligently placing computation, but queries that aren't optimized for dual execution may incur transfer penalties.

3. **Query planning overhead**: The Dual Execution query planner determines where to execute each part of a query (locally vs. cloud). While optimizations reduce round trips "from two to one," this planning adds some overhead compared to purely local DuckDB execution.

4. **Cloud compute cold start**: Unlike local DuckDB which runs in-process, cloud resources may need initialization time.

**Best practice**: For latency-sensitive queries on local data, use DuckDB locally. Use MotherDuck when you need cloud-scale data, collaboration, or when data already resides in MotherDuck storage.
