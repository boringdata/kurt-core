# Answer

A **MotherDuck database** is a standard database where you can read and write data. You have full control over the data, including the ability to create, modify, and delete tables.

A **share** is a read-only database designed specifically for data collaboration and ad-hoc analytics. Key characteristics:

- **Read-only access**: Recipients can query but not modify the data
- **Zero-copy cloning**: Users access the same dataset without duplicating storage
- **Purpose-built for sharing**: Ideal for providing data access to collaborators or external parties

In essence: databases are for data you own and manage, while shares are for data you want others to consume without giving them write access.
