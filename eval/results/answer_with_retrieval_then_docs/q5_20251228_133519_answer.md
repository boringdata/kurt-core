# Answer

To set up MotherDuck to work with dbt:

1. **Install the dbt-duckdb adapter:**
   ```bash
   pip install dbt-duckdb
   ```

2. **Configure your `profiles.yml`** (typically at `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`):
   ```yaml
   your_project:
     target: dev
     outputs:
       dev:
         type: duckdb
         path: md:your_database_name
         extensions:
           - motherduck
   ```

3. **Set the MotherDuck token** as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export motherduck_token=<your_token>
   ```
   You can get your token from the MotherDuck web UI.

4. **Initialize your dbt project** (if new):
   ```bash
   dbt init your_project_name
   ```

5. **Run dbt commands** as usual:
   ```bash
   dbt run
   dbt build
   ```

dbt Core projects run extremely fast with MotherDuck—one user reported dbt runs that "dropped from 8 hours to 2 minutes" after migrating from dbt Cloud with traditional warehouses.
