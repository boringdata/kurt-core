# Answer

Based on the available documentation from MotherDuck, here are the SQL features from DuckDB that are **not yet fully supported** or have limitations in MotherDuck:

## 1. Full Text Search (FTS) Extension
The `create_fts_index` PRAGMA command **will not work in the MotherDuck UI**. The commands must be run using the DuckDB CLI or other clients. This means FTS index creation is only available when connecting via local DuckDB clients, not through the web interface.

## 2. PySpark Integration
Running PySpark code with the DuckDB engine (an experimental DuckDB feature) is **not yet supported on MotherDuck**. This feature allows running PySpark DataFrame operations using DuckDB as the execution engine locally, but this capability does not extend to the cloud service.

## 3. Python UDFs (User-Defined Functions)
While DuckDB supports Python UDFs for custom data transformations, the documentation indicates these run in the Python interpreter context. In MotherDuck's cloud execution model (where queries run on containerized "ducklings"), Python UDFs would require local execution. The dual execution model can run some operations locally, but UDFs that depend on the Python runtime may have limitations in pure cloud execution scenarios.

## 4. Community Extensions
While DuckDB supports community extensions that can be installed with `INSTALL extension FROM community`, MotherDuck primarily supports **core extensions** that are auto-loaded. The documentation mentions that core extensions like spatial, httpfs, parquet, and iceberg work in MotherDuck, but community-developed extensions may have compatibility limitations in the cloud environment.

## 5. Third-Party/Unsigned Extensions
DuckDB allows loading unsigned or custom extensions by setting the `allow_unsigned_extensions` flag. In a managed cloud service like MotherDuck, there are likely security restrictions on loading arbitrary unsigned extensions on the server side.

## 6. Local File System Operations
DuckDB's ability to write directly to local file paths (e.g., `COPY TO 'local_path.parquet'`) works differently in MotherDuck. MotherDuck's storage layer maps logical database files to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage, rather than a local filesystem.

## Important Context: Dual Execution Model
MotherDuck uses a **dual execution model** that intelligently decides whether to run parts of a query locally or remotely in the cloud. Some DuckDB features that work locally may behave differently or have limitations when executed in the cloud:
- Operations on **local data** can run locally
- Operations on **MotherDuck databases** run in the cloud
- Users can force execution location using `md_run = 'local'` or `md_run = 'remote'` in scan functions

## Retrieved Context Summary

**Retrieval query used:** "SQL features, unsupported, limitations, DuckDB, MotherDuck, compatibility" and "unsupported features, not supported, limitations, restrictions, DuckDB compatibility, MotherDuck limitations"

**Key entities matched:**
- DuckDB (Technology)
- MotherDuck (Company)
- SQL (Topic)
- Various DuckDB versions (1.3, 1.4)
- Extensions (Core Extensions, Community Extensions)

**Main claims/facts retrieved:**
- DuckDB extensions fall into core (maintained by DuckDB team) and community categories
- MotherDuck integrates via DuckDB's extension system without forking
- Core extensions auto-load when needed
- Dual execution model splits queries between local and cloud

**Was the context sufficient?** Partially - the retrieval provided general information about DuckDB and MotherDuck architecture but did not directly surface a comprehensive list of unsupported features. Additional document searches were necessary.
