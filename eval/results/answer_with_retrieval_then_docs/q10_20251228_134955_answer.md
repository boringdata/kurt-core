# Answer

Based on the indexed MotherDuck documentation, the knowledge graph shows the following DuckDB versions referenced in MotherDuck content:

- **DuckDB 1.4** - Described as "the latest version of DuckDB" and shown as integrating with MotherDuck
- **DuckDB 1.3 / 1.3.0** - Referenced as a supported version with performance improvements
- **DuckDB 1.1.0 and 1.1.1** - Historical versions mentioned in documentation

**Note:** The specific "support-policy" document (https://motherduck.com/support-policy) that would contain official version support details is in an ERROR state and couldn't be retrieved from the indexed content. The version information above is inferred from entity metadata extracted from blog posts and documentation.

For the most accurate and current version support information, refer to MotherDuck's official support policy page directly.
