What file formats are most efficient for loading data into MotherDuck?|"The most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck are Parquet and ORC, as they are optimized for analytical queries and are well-suited for use with DuckDB. Reasoning To determine the most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck, we need to consider the architecture and capabilities of MotherDuck, which is based on DuckDB. DuckDB is known for its efficient handling of columnar data formats, which are typically used in data lakehouses and data warehouses. The entities and relationships suggest a focus on modern data architectures like data lakehouses, which often utilize columnar storage formats such as Parquet and ORC for their efficiency in both storage and query performance.

1|answer_motherduck_without_kg|https://github.com/anthropics/kurt-core/blob/main/eval/scenarios/answer_motherduck_without_kg.yaml|...... What file formats are most efficient for loading data into MotherDuck?|When loading data into MotherDuck, Parquet is the most efficient file format, followed by other columnar formats. Here's what makes different formats efficient or inefficient: Most Efficient: Parquet Parquet is the optimal choice for loading data into MotherDuck due to several key advantages: Columnar Storage: Parquet organizes data by columns rather than rows, which enables faster retrieval when analytical queries focus on specific columns. All values for a particular column are stored contiguously on disk, enabling better compression ratios. Superior Compression: Parquet uses specialized encoding techniques such as dictionary encoding, run-length encoding, and delta encoding to optimize storage. This reduces the data footprint, translating to cost savings and improved access speeds by minimizing I/O operations. Query Optimization Features: • Predicate Pushdown: Filtering operations are pushed closer to the storage layer, reducing the amount of data that needs processing • Column Pruning: Only the columns needed for a query are read from disk • Built-in Statistics: Parquet files contain min/max values per column chunk (row groups) that help DuckDB skip reading parts of files that don't match query predicates Schema Evolution Support: Parquet handles evolving data structures with ease, allowing seamless schema modifications like adding or altering columns without disrupting existing workflows. DuckDB/MotherDuck Optimization: DuckDB's architecture is purpose-built to leverage Parquet's column-oriented design. The platform can directly query Parquet files without importing them first, and supports efficient SQL-driven exports to Parquet with advanced compression options. Other Format Considerations CSV Files • Pros: Simple, universal, human-readable, and easy to edit with no dependencies • Cons: • Lacks compression and schema management • Row-based format (not optimized for analytical queries) • No built-in statistics for query optimization • Requires more storage space • Can have encoding and parsing issues • Use Case: Good for data exchange and initial data loading, but should be converted to Parquet for efficient querying Apache ORC • Pros: Columnar storage with efficient compression, ACID transaction support • Cons: Primarily optimized for Hive/Hadoop ecosystems • Efficiency: Similar to Parquet but less universally supported Apache Avro • Pros: Flexible row-based format with good schema evolution support • Cons: Row-based design makes it less efficient for analytical queries compared to columnar formats • Use Case: Better for streaming and cross-system data exchange than analytics Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg • Note: These are table formats, not file formats. They typically use Parquet as their underlying file format while adding transaction management, versioning, and metadata capabilities. Performance Best Practices When loading data into MotherDuck: Use Partitioned Writes: For large datasets, partition Parquet files using COPY TO ... PARTITION_BY with appropriate partition keys (e.g., by date) to improve query performance through partition pruning. Avoid Too Many Small Files: Aim for partition sizes of at least 100MB each. Thousands of tiny files slow down file listing operations, especially on cloud storage. Consider Compression: DuckDB supports compression options like GZIP and ZSTD when writing Parquet files, which can further reduce storage costs. Direct Parquet Queries: DuckDB can query Parquet files directly without loading them into a table first, which is faster for exploratory analysis. DuckLake for Advanced Features: For petabyte-scale workloads requiring open format compatibility with Spark and other engines, consider DuckLake. However, MotherDuck's native storage offers 2-10x faster query performance for most workloads. Storage Trade-offs DuckLake (with Parquet): • Open format with broader ecosystem compatibility • Support for Spark and other compute engines • Better suited for petabyte-scale workloads • Supports encryption for secure data lakes MotherDuck Native Storage: • 2-10x faster query performance than DuckLake • Optimized for read/write throughput • Better caching and regional performance • Best for most analytical workloads Practical Loading Examples Convert CSV to Parquet for efficient loading: Query Parquet files directly: Partitioned writes for large datasets:|Parquet is the most efficient file format for loading data into MotherDuck.

2|answer_motherduck_without_kg|https://github.com/anthropics/kurt-core/blob/main/eval/scenarios/answer_motherduck_without_kg.yaml|...How does MotherDuck integrate with DuckDB?|"MotherDuck integrates with DuckDB through a sophisticated hybrid architecture built on three core principles: extending DuckDB without forking it, enabling seamless local-to-cloud connectivity, and implementing an intelligent dual execution model. Connection and Extension Architecture MotherDuck integrates with DuckDB using DuckDB's powerful extension system rather than maintaining a separate forked version. Users can connect their local DuckDB instance to MotherDuck with a simple ATTACH command, which works across multiple environments including the CLI, Python scripts, JDBC connections, and even in the browser via WebAssembly (WASM). This extension-based approach allows MotherDuck to add capabilities at multiple layers—including the SQL parser, optimizer, and storage interface—while staying current with the latest open source DuckDB releases. The architecture consists of three main layers: Client Extension: Enables integration across the DuckDB ecosystem and runs DuckDB in the browser via WASM for the MotherDuck UI Compute Layer: Processes queries using containerized DuckDB instances (""ducklings"") in the cloud that scale based on user needs Storage Layer: Implements a differential storage system that maps logical database files to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage, solving DuckDB's single-writer limitation for multi-user cloud environments Dual Execution Model The most innovative aspect of MotherDuck's integration is its dual execution model, which treats a user's laptop and the MotherDuck cloud as two nodes in a single distributed system. When a query is executed, MotherDuck's optimizer intelligently decides whether to run parts of the query locally on the client or remotely in the cloud, with the primary goal of minimizing data movement. For example, when joining a local CSV file with a cloud-based table: • The system scans the local CSV on the user's laptop • Applies filters locally to reduce data size • Transfers only the minimal filtered data (potentially just a few bytes) to the cloud • Performs the final join against the large cloud table in MotherDuck This approach can reduce network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods that would require uploading entire local files or downloading complete cloud tables. Users can verify which parts of a query run where using the EXPLAIN statement, which shows local operations marked as (L) and remote operations as (R). Single-Engine Semantics Because MotherDuck uses the exact same DuckDB engine both locally and in the cloud, queries validated on a laptop are guaranteed to behave identically in production. This eliminates the common ""it worked on my machine"" problem and provides true dev-to-prod consistency. This architecture offers three key benefits: Faster Development: Engineers can build and test pipelines with zero-latency local feedback before scaling to cloud Lower Costs: By leveraging free local compute and minimizing data transfer, cloud bills are significantly reduced Better Collaboration: Transforms the traditionally single-player DuckDB into a multiplayer platform where teams can share databases Additional Cloud Features MotherDuck extends DuckDB's capabilities with cloud-native features: • Database Sharing: Team members can grant query access to databases without emailing files or scripts • Secret Manager: Centralized, encrypted storage for credentials to access external data sources (S3, GCS, Delta Lake) • Per-User Tenancy: Each user gets isolated DuckDB instances (ducklings) in various sizes (pulse, standard, jumbo, mega, giga) • Serverless Scaling: Compute scales to zero when not in use, with billing at second-level granularity Manual Control Options While the optimizer typically makes efficient choices automatically, users can override execution location using the md_run parameter in scan functions like read_parquet() or read_csv(). Setting md_run = 'remote' forces operations to run in MotherDuck's cloud, while md_run = 'local' forces local execution. This control is useful for performance tuning—for example, querying a 2GB Parquet file on S3 remotely in MotherDuck was shown to be significantly faster (25 seconds) than downloading it locally first (36 seconds)."|MotherDuck is built on top of DuckDB and provides a serverless cloud data warehouse.

3|answer_motherduck_without_kg|https://github.com/anthropics/kurt-core/blob/main/eval/scenarios/answer_motherduck_without_kg.yaml|...What SQL features from DuckDB are not yet supported in MotherDuck?|"Based on the available documentation, MotherDuck is built on DuckDB and maintains compatibility with DuckDB's core SQL features. However, there are some architectural differences and limitations inherent to MotherDuck's cloud-based nature compared to local DuckDB: Storage Model Differences Single-Writer File System: DuckDB's native file format is optimized for a single writer on a local file system. This model is not well-suited for the cloud, where multiple users need to read and write to the same database concurrently. MotherDuck addresses this by implementing a differential storage system that maps a logical database file to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage, which is fundamentally different from DuckDB's local file-based approach. Hybrid Execution Model MotherDuck uses a dual execution architecture where queries can run either locally on the client, remotely in the MotherDuck cloud, or as a hybrid of both. While this is powerful, it means that certain operations may behave differently than in pure local DuckDB. The optimizer automatically decides query execution location, though users can override this with the md_run parameter in functions like read_parquet() or read_csv(). Collaboration and Concurrency While DuckDB is fundamentally a ""single-player"" embedded database, MotherDuck transforms it into a collaborative ""multiplayer"" platform. This requires architectural differences in how concurrent writes are handled. MotherDuck provides isolated compute instances (called ""ducklings"") per user to handle concurrent access, whereas local DuckDB has limited support for concurrent writes to ensure data integrity. Storage Backend MotherDuck uses its own storage layer rather than DuckDB's native file format. The system offers: • MotherDuck native storage: Fast, low-latency storage for the data warehouse • DuckLake storage: For petabyte-scale data, using a database-backed metadata catalog and S3-compatible object storage • Hybrid approach: Can query data across local files, MotherDuck cloud storage, and external sources like S3 This is different from DuckDB's approach of working directly with local database files (.db files) or reading from file formats like Parquet and CSV. Extension System Integration MotherDuck leverages DuckDB's extension system to add capabilities rather than forking the codebase. This means MotherDuck extends DuckDB at multiple layers including the SQL parser, optimizer, and storage interface. While this maintains compatibility, it means some features are implemented through extensions rather than being native. Key Architectural Components MotherDuck's architecture consists of three main layers not present in standalone DuckDB: Client Extension: Enables connection to MotherDuck via the ATTACH command Cloud Compute Layer: Containerized DuckDB instances (""ducklings"") that scale based on user needs Differential Storage Layer: Cloud-optimized storage that enables features like database sharing and time travel Important Notes The documentation does not provide an explicit list of ""SQL features not supported in MotherDuck."" Instead, MotherDuck is positioned as an enhancement to DuckDB that maintains SQL compatibility while adding cloud-scale capabilities like: • Centralized Secret Manager for managing credentials • Database sharing for team collaboration • Time travel (with DuckLake) • Automatic scaling and resource management The fundamental SQL query capabilities appear to be preserved, with differences primarily in the underlying storage, execution model, and multi-user collaboration features rather than in unsupported SQL syntax or functions."|MotherDuck aims for high compatibility with DuckDB but may have some limitations with certain extensions, user-defined functions, or very recent DuckDB features that haven't been integrated yet.
