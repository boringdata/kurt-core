1|answer_motherduck_with_kg|...... What file formats are most efficient for loading data into MotherDuck?|The most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck are Parquet and ORC, as they are optimized for analytical queries and are well-suited for use with DuckDB. Reasoning To determine the most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck, we need to consider the architecture and capabilities of MotherDuck, which is based on DuckDB. DuckDB is known for its efficient handling of columnar data formats, which are typically used in data lakehouses and data warehouses.
