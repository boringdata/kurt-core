While DuckDB excels at processing data on a local machine, the dynamics of data analysis change when dealing with cloud-scale data, collaboration, and shared resources. This shift introduces challenges around [security](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/secure-startup-data-warehouse/), concurrent access, and performance, which is where a purpose-built cloud architecture becomes essential.\n\nMotherDuck, a modern cloud data warehouse, is built on DuckDB to solve these challenges. It extends DuckDB\u2019s capabilities without forking the open source project, creating a hybrid system that intelligently balances local and cloud computing. In a conversation with MotherDuck founding engineer Stephanie, she explained the architecture and the innovative query model, known as **dual execution**, that makes this possible.\n\n* * *\n\n## The MotherDuck Architecture: Beyond Hosted DuckDB\n\nA common misconception is that MotherDuck is simply DuckDB hosted in the cloud. The reality is a more sophisticated system designed to overcome the limitations of using a locally-optimized engine in a distributed environment. MotherDuck\u2019s architecture is built on three key components and a core philosophy of not forking DuckDB.\n\nInstead of maintaining a separate version, MotherDuck leverages DuckDB\u2019s powerful **extension system**. This allows MotherDuck to add new capabilities at multiple layers, including the SQL parser, optimizer, and storage interface, while staying current with the latest open source DuckDB releases. This tight integration means users benefit from the rapid innovation of the DuckDB community almost immediately.\n\nThe architecture can be broken down into three main layers:\n\n1. **The Client Extension**: This is how MotherDuck integrates with the DuckDB ecosystem. Whether a user is working in the CLI, a Python script, or a JDBC connection, a simple `ATTACH` command connects their local DuckDB instance to the MotherDuck cloud. This extension is even used to run DuckDB in the browser via WASM for the MotherDuck UI, enabling client-side processing to reduce latency and cloud compute costs.\n2. **The Compute Layer**: In the cloud, queries are processed by containerized DuckDB instances, fondly called \"ducklings.\" These compute resources are scaled based on user needs, providing the necessary CPU and memory to handle complex analytical queries on large datasets.\n3. **The Storage Layer**: DuckDB's native file format is optimized for a single writer on a local file system. This model is not well-suited for the cloud, where multiple users need to read and write to the same database concurrently. To solve this, MotherDuck implemented a differential storage system that maps a logical database file to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage. This design is cloud-friendly, enabling efficient in-place updates and forming the foundation for features like database sharing and time travel.\n\n* * *\n\n## Enabling Collaboration with Database Sharing and Secure Credentials\n\nThis unique architecture transforms DuckDB from a \"single-player\" tool into a collaborative \"multiplayer\" platform. One of the most significant advantages is **database sharing**. Instead of emailing SQL scripts or passing around large database files, team members within the same organization can grant query access to their databases. This streamlines collaboration, ensuring everyone works from a consistent and up-to-date version of the data.\n\nSecurity is another critical aspect of any cloud data platform. MotherDuck provides a **centralized Secret Manager**, co-designed with the DuckDB team. Users can create persistent, encrypted secrets for accessing external data sources like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Delta Lake. Once a secret is created in MotherDuck, it can be reused across different clients and sessions without needing to expose or reconfigure credentials on each local machine.\n\n* * *\n\n## Understanding Dual Execution\n\nThe most innovative feature of MotherDuck's architecture is its **dual execution model**. This is a hybrid query execution strategy where the optimizer intelligently decides whether to run parts of a query locally on the client or remotely in the MotherDuck cloud. The primary goal is to minimize data movement and leverage compute where it makes the most sense.\n\nThe process was demonstrated with a query joining two tables. When both tables reside in a MotherDuck database, the query is executed entirely in the cloud. An `EXPLAIN` plan for this query reveals that all operators, from the table scans to the final join, are marked as **remote**. The only local operation is downloading the final result set to the client.\n\nThe real power of dual execution becomes apparent when a query involves both local and cloud data. In the demonstration, one of the remote tables was copied to a local Parquet file. The query was then modified to join this local file with the table that remained in the cloud.\n\nThe `EXPLAIN` plan for this new query showed a mix of local and remote operations. The scan of the Parquet file and its associated processing happened **locally**, leveraging the user's machine. The scan of the cloud table happened **remotely** on MotherDuck's compute. The system then efficiently transferred only the necessary intermediate data to complete the join. This hybrid approach avoids needlessly uploading the local file to the cloud or downloading the entire remote table, resulting in faster and more efficient queries.\n\n* * *\n\n## Taking Control with Manual Execution Overrides\n\nWhile MotherDuck's optimizer is designed to make the most efficient choice automatically, some situations require manual control. For this, users can use the `md_run` parameter within scan functions like `read_parquet()` or `read_csv()`.\n\nBy setting `md_run = 'local'`, a user can force the scan of a remote S3 file to be executed on their local client. This involves downloading the data, which might be desirable if the data needs to be processed near the user's location or if they prefer using local credentials. Conversely, setting `md_run = 'remote'` forces the operation to run in the MotherDuck cloud.\n\nThis control is especially useful for performance tuning. A direct comparison showed that querying a 2GB Parquet file on S3 was significantly faster when executed remotely in MotherDuck (25 seconds) compared to a local DuckDB client that had to first download the data (36 seconds). By pushing the computation to the data's location, MotherDuck minimizes network I/O and delivers results more quickly.\n\n* * *\n\n## A Symbiotic Future for Local and Cloud Analytics\n\nMotherDuck's architecture is a thoughtful extension of DuckDB's core principles, adapting its local-first power for the demands of the cloud. The dual execution model provides a flexible and efficient bridge between a user's laptop and cloud data, optimizing workloads in a way that pure-cloud or pure-local systems cannot.\n\nThis relationship is symbiotic. As the largest production user of DuckDB, MotherDuck continuously pushes the engine to its limits, uncovering opportunities for improvement and contributing enhancements back to the open source project. This collaboration ensures that both DuckDB and MotherDuck will continue to evolve, offering a powerful and seamless analytical experience that spans from local exploration to cloud-scale production.\n\n...SHOW MORE\n\n## Related Videos\n\n[![\"Escaping Catalog Hell: A Guide to Iceberg, DuckDB & the Data Lakehouse\" video thumbnail](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Ficeberg_video_thumbnail_adfdabe3d6.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\\\\\n\\\\\n46:26](https://motherduck.com/videos/escaping-catalog-hell-a-guide-to-iceberg-duckdb-the-data-lakehouse/)\n\n[2025-06-12](https://motherduck.com/videos/escaping-catalog-hell-a-guide-to-iceberg-duckdb-the-data-lakehouse/)\n\n### [Escaping Catalog Hell: A Guide to Iceberg, DuckDB & the Data Lakehouse](https://motherduck.com/videos/escaping-catalog-hell-a-guide-to-iceberg-duckdb-the-data-lakehouse)\n\nBuilding a data stack means choosing between easy SaaS and complex open-source.

DuckDB is a lightweight, in-process analytical database that runs on your laptop inside of Python and can wrangle large datasets efficiently, both from local and remote data sources. In this talk, we will show you how to query a dataset with DuckDB to extract, load and transform data right on your laptop. We'll then show you how to move your workloads to the Cloud, so you can run them at scale. By developing locally and pushing to the Cloud it's not only easy to develop, debug and iterate, but also makes it easy to quickly switch back and forth between workloads that do and don't require Cloud compute resources, cutting both cost and time.\n\n...SHOW MORE\n\n## Related Videos\n\n[![\"Data-based: Going Beyond the Dataframe\" video thumbnail](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2FData_based_f32745b461.png&w=3840&q=75)](https://motherduck.com/videos/going-beyond-the-dataframe/)\n\n[2025-11-20](https://motherduck.com/videos/going-beyond-the-dataframe/)\n\n### [Data-based: Going Beyond the Dataframe](https://motherduck.com/videos/going-beyond-the-dataframe)\n\nLearn how to turbocharge your Python data work using DuckDB and MotherDuck with Pandas.

Unlike traditional big data systems that emerged in the early 2000s with technologies like Hadoop and Spark, MotherDuck takes a different approach by recognizing two key changes in the modern data landscape:\n\n- **Modern hardware is significantly more powerful**: Today's laptops have multiple cores and substantial RAM, with some EC2 instances offering hundreds of cores and terabytes of memory\n- **Most queries aren't actually \"big data\"**: Analysis shows that 99% of queries on systems like Redshift and Snowflake can fit on a single large node, with most under a gigabyte\n\nMotherDuck's architecture is built on three core pillars:\n\n1. **Effortless and serverless**: Pay only for what you use without managing resources or clusters\n2. **Dedicated instances**: Each user gets their own \"duckling\" (DuckDB instance) to avoid noisy neighbor problems\n3. **Dual execution query engine**: Run queries locally, in the cloud, or combine both for optimal performance\n\n## The Problem with Traditional SQL Workflows\n\nTraditional SQL development follows a frustrating pattern that breaks flow state:\n\n1. Write your query\n2. Hit the run button\n3. Wait for results\n4. Debug errors\n5. Repeat\n\nThis write-wait-debug cycle can happen hundreds or thousands of times when developing new queries. Each wait forces a context switch that exhausts mental energy and disrupts concentration. As Hamilton, a front-end engineer at MotherDuck, explains, this interaction model hasn't fundamentally changed since the 1970s.\n\nThe lack of observability tools in SQL makes debugging particularly challenging:\n\n- **CTE debugging**: Common Table Expressions are notoriously difficult to debug, requiring manual commenting and isolation\n- **Complex expressions**: Breaking apart column expressions to identify issues requires writing more SQL\n- **No immediate feedback**: Unlike modern development environments, SQL lacks real-time validation and preview capabilities\n\n## Introducing Instant SQL\n\nInstant SQL transforms SQL development by providing immediate feedback on every keystroke, similar to how digital audio workstations (DAWs) work in music production. The system is guided by Brett Victor's principle: \"Creators need an immediate connection to what they create.\"\n\n### Key Features\n\n**Real-time Query Execution**\n\n- Results update with every keystroke (50-100ms latency)\n- Powered by DuckDB's local execution capabilities\n- Smart caching and query rewriting for performance\n\n**Advanced Observability**\n\n- Click on any column to decompose complex expressions\n- Navigate through CTEs with instant result previews\n- Parser-aware syntax highlighting showing query structure\n\n**AI Integration**\n\n- Context-aware suggestions based on cursor position\n- Real-time preview of AI-generated changes\n- Semantic understanding of query intent\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nInstant SQL leverages several technical innovations:\n\n### Parser-Powered Intelligence\n\nDuckDB exposes its query parser through SQL, allowing Instant SQL to:\n\n- Generate abstract syntax trees (AST)\n- Identify expression boundaries and table references\n- Create a semantic path through the query based on cursor position\n\n### Intelligent Caching Strategy\n\nThe system automatically:\n\n- Parses queries to identify table references\n- Builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies\n- Creates optimized caches for interactive modeling\n- Rewrites queries to use cached data\n\n### Dual Execution with MotherDuck\n\nFor large datasets, MotherDuck's architecture enables:\n\n- Server-side scanning and filtering of massive tables\n- Local caching of relevant subsets\n- Seamless coordination between cloud and local execution\n\n## Practical Applications\n\n### Local File Exploration\n\nQuery local files directly without uploading to the cloud:\n\n```sql\nCopy code\n\nSELECT * FROM 'path/to/file.parquet'\n```\n\n### Cross-Database Queries\n\nCombine data from multiple sources:\n\n- MotherDuck tables\n- PostgreSQL replicas\n- Local files\n- S3 object storage\n\n### Interactive Data Modeling\n\n- Modify CTEs and see downstream impacts immediately\n- Test transformations without full query execution\n- Debug complex joins and aggregations in real-time\n\n## Performance at Scale\n\nInstant SQL scales effectively through:\n\n- **Smart sampling**: For terabyte-scale data, it samples intelligently\n- **Filtered caching**: WHERE clauses execute server-side to minimize data transfer\n- **Incremental updates**: Only affected parts of the query are re-executed\n\nThe system works with datasets ranging from local CSV files to 100+ billion row tables in MotherDuck, adapting its caching strategy based on data size and query complexity.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo try Instant SQL:\n\n- Sign up for a MotherDuck account at motherduck.com\n- Run `duckdb -i` for local-only exploration without an account\n- Join the community at slack.motherduck.com for support and feedback\n\nInstant SQL represents a fundamental shift in SQL development, transforming a traditionally passive, wait-heavy process into an active, immediate experience that keeps developers in flow state while writing complex analytical queries.\n\n...SHOW MORE\n\n## Related Videos\n\n[![\"Data-based: Going Beyond the Dataframe\" video thumbnail](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2FData_based_f32745b461.png&w=3840&q=75)](https://motherduck.com/videos/going-beyond-the-dataframe/)\n\n[2025-11-20](https://motherduck.com/videos/going-beyond-the-dataframe/)\n\n### [Data-based: Going Beyond the Dataframe](https://motherduck.com/videos/going-beyond-the-dataframe)\n\nLearn how to turbocharge your Python data work using DuckDB and MotherDuck with Pandas.

A path that gives you the power of a massive data warehouse without the overhead, designed specifically for teams who move fast?\n\nThis guide is for the technical founders, first data hires, and lean analytics teams feeling this pain. We'll provide a clear framework for evaluating if MotherDuck is the right solution to solve your dashboard latency issues, scale your analytics, and empower your team to make faster, data-driven decisions.\n\n### What You'll Learn in This Guide\n\n**What Causes Dashboard Latency?**We'll uncover why your current database struggles with analytical queries and identify the key architectural bottlenecks.**How Do You Scale Beyond a Single Node?**Discover the limitations of single-node engines for large datasets and how MotherDuck's hybrid architecture provides a straightforward path to scale.**How Can You Achieve Real-Time Insights?**Learn how to move from stale, batch-updated data to sub-second freshness without overloading your production systems.**What Does a Migration Look Like?**Follow a practical, week-by-week plan to migrate a critical workload to MotherDuck and start seeing results in under 30 days.**Is MotherDuck the Right Fit for Your Startup?**Get a clear comparison of when MotherDuck excels and what limitations to consider for your specific use case.\n\n## Why Are My Startup's BI Dashboards So Slow?\n\nIf your dashboards are grinding to a halt, the problem usually isn't a single query but an architectural mismatch. Most startups begin by running analytics on a replica of their production database, often a system like PostgreSQL or MySQL. These are [ Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/what-is-OLAP/) databases, brilliant for handling thousands of small, fast transactions like creating a user or processing an order.\n\nHowever, analytical queries are a completely different beast. They are **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)** workloads, which involve scanning millions or billions of rows across a few columns to calculate aggregations. Asking an OLTP database to perform heavy OLAP queries is like asking a race car to haul lumber. It wasn't built for the job.\n\nThe core issue lies in how the data is stored on disk. OLTP databases are **row-oriented**, meaning they store all the data for a single record together. When your BI tool asks for the total number of users by `plan_type`\n\nfrom a table with 50 columns, a row-oriented database is forced to read all 50 columns for every single row, even though it only needs one. This wastes an enormous amount of I/O.\n\nThis is where [ columnar storage](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/columnar-storage-guide/), the foundation of modern analytical databases like DuckDB, makes a big difference. A columnar database stores all values from a single column together. When you run the same query, it reads\n\n*only*the\n\n`plan_type`\n\ncolumn, dramatically reducing the amount of data scanned. This fundamental difference is often the key to unlocking sub-second query performance.### How Do Row and Columnar Databases Compare for Analytics?\n\n| Feature | Row-Oriented (e.g., PostgreSQL) | Column-Oriented (e.g., DuckDB/MotherDuck) |\n|---|---|---|\nPrimary Use Case | OLTP: Fast reads and writes of individual records. | OLAP: Fast scans and aggregations over large datasets. |\nData Layout | Stores all values for a single record contiguously. | Stores all values for a single column contiguously. |\nQuery Performance | Slow for analytical queries that only need a few columns. | Extremely fast for analytical queries. It only reads the required columns. |\nCompression | Less effective, as it stores mixed data types in each row. | Highly effective, leading to smaller storage footprint and faster scans. |\n\n## What Happens When My Analytics Queries Need to Scan Billions of Rows?\n\nAs your startup succeeds, your data volume explodes. The single-node analytics database that was once a perfect solution starts to show its limits. While an engine like DuckDB is incredibly fast and can even process datasets larger than RAM by [\"spilling\" intermediate results to disk](https://duckdb.org/2024/07/09/memory-management.html), it is ultimately constrained by the resources of a single machine.\n\nWhen you run a complex query with multiple joins and aggregations on billions of rows, the intermediate data generated can overwhelm the system's memory. This can lead to slow queries as the engine constantly writes to and reads from disk, or worse, an [ OutOfMemoryException](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/troubleshooting/oom_errors.html) that kills the query entirely.\n\nFurthermore, a single node has a finite capacity for **concurrency**. As more team members connect with BI tools, the CPU and I/O resources get saturated, and everyone's queries slow down. This is the practical ceiling of a single-node engine. This is precisely the problem MotherDuck was built to solve. It extends the lightning-fast local experience of DuckDB with a serverless cloud backend, giving you a straightforward path to scale.\n\n## How Does MotherDuck's Hybrid Architecture Deliver Speed and Scale?\n\nMotherDuck introduces a novel architecture that gives you the best of both worlds: the zero-latency feel of local development and the on-demand power of the cloud. This is achieved through a few key concepts.\n\n### What is Dual Execution and Why Does it Matter?\n\nThe magic behind MotherDuck is its [ Dual Execution query planner](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2024/papers/p46-atwal.pdf). Instead of forcing you to move all your data to the cloud, it intelligently pushes the computation to where the data lives, minimizing network latency and data transfer costs.\n\n**Local Query:**If you query a CSV file on your laptop, the query runs entirely on your local DuckDB instance. The result is instantaneous.**Cloud Query:**If you query a large table stored in MotherDuck, the work is routed to a dedicated, serverless compute instance (a \"Duckling\") in the cloud.**Hybrid Query:**This is where it gets powerful. If you join a local file with a large cloud table, the planner is smart enough to push filters down to your local machine first. It processes the local file, sends only the small, filtered result to the cloud, and then performs the final join. This makes complex queries incredibly efficient.\n\n### How Do You Handle High Concurrency from BI Tools?\n\nA common and dangerous blind spot for startups is how BI tools handle concurrency. Tools like Tableau or Looker often use a single service account, funneling queries from dozens of users through one connection. This can quickly overwhelm a database.\n\n## Case Study: How Layers Solved Its Concurrency Bottleneck\n\nThe SaaS company\n\n[faced this exact problem. Their analytics, running on PostgreSQL, were overwhelmed when their BI tool masked 73 simultaneous users behind a single service account. This exhausted their connection pool and caused a high rate of query timeouts.]LayersAfter migrating to MotherDuck, they used the\n\nRead Scalingfeature. By connecting their BI tool with a special Read Scaling Token, user queries were automatically distributed across a pool of 16 dedicated, read-only DuckDB replicas. This instantly parallelized the workload, providing each user session with isolated compute. The result was a dramatic improvement in stability, with BI query timeouts dropping to virtually zero.\n\nBy issuing a unique, read-only token for each BI integration and using the `session_hint`\n\nparameter, you can ensure user queries are [intelligently load-balanced](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/authenticating-and-connecting-to-motherduck/read-scaling/), providing a consistently fast experience for everyone.\n\n## Why Might Lakehouse Architectures Have High Latency Issues?\n\nThe lakehouse architecture, which combines a data lake's flexibility with a data warehouse's performance, is a popular choice. However, startups often find that it comes with a significant \"latency tax,\" especially for interactive queries.\n\nThe primary culprit is the [ \"small files problem.\"](https://dev.to/thedanicafine/the-apache-iceberg-small-file-problem-1k2m) Streaming ingestion jobs often write thousands of tiny files to cloud object storage like Amazon S3. To run a query, the engine must make thousands of separate, high-latency HTTP requests just to read the metadata and find the right files. Each request can take 100-200 milliseconds, adding up to seconds of delay before a single byte of data is even processed.\n\nA benchmark demonstrated this vividly: a query scanning a 5 GB Apache Iceberg table with thousands of small files took **5.093 seconds** to run. The same query on MotherDuck's **DuckLake** format, which uses a database-backed index to avoid scanning S3 for metadata, returned in just **0.146 seconds**, a [ 34x speedup](https://motherduck.com/blog/open-lakehouse-stack-duckdb-table-formats/).\n\n### How Does DuckLake Compare to Apache Iceberg?\n\n| Feature | Apache Iceberg (Standard) | MotherDuck DuckLake |\n|---|---|---|\nMetadata Storage | Stored as files (manifests) in the object store (e.g., S3). | Stored in a fast, transactional database, separate from data files. |\nQuery Planning | Requires multiple sequential S3 reads to discover which data files to scan. | A single SQL query to the catalog database returns the exact list of files. |\nSmall File Handling | Creates many small data and metadata files, requiring costly maintenance jobs (compaction). | Dramatically reduces metadata overhead and the need for frequent compaction. |\nPerformance | High latency for interactive queries due to metadata discovery overhead. |\n34x faster |\n\n## How Can I Get Real-Time Data Without Overloading My Production Database?\n\nIs your sales dashboard always 30 minutes out of date? This frustrating lag is almost always due to a reliance on traditional, batch-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs that run on a schedule. For a startup that needs to react instantly to user behavior, this is no longer acceptable.\n\nThe modern solution is a streaming architecture built on **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. Instead of querying your production database tables (which adds heavy load), CDC tools like Estuary or [Streamkap](https://motherduck.com/blog/streamkap-mysql-to-motherduck/) monitor the database's internal transaction log. They capture every insert, update, and delete as it happens and stream these events to MotherDuck in near real-time, often with [ less than 100ms of latency](https://estuary.dev/destination/motherduck/).\n\nThis approach provides two critical benefits:\n\n**Sub-Minute Freshness:**Your analytics are always synchronized with reality.**Zero Production Impact:**It completely isolates your analytical workload, ensuring that heavy queries never slow down your customer-facing application.\n\n## What Are the Signs My Startup Has Outgrown Its Current Analytics Stack?\n\nThe signs that you've outgrown your analytics stack are both technical and cultural. Recognizing them early can save you from months of frustration and slow decision-making.\n\n**Technical Red Flags:**\n\n**High Query Latency:**Your p95 query latency for interactive dashboards consistently exceeds 2-5 seconds. Research shows that[beyond 1 second, users lose their flow of thought, and beyond 10 seconds, you lose their attention entirely](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux/).**Rising Error Rates:**You see an increase in query timeouts, connection failures, or application errors related to database load.**Stale Data:**Business teams complain that dashboards are always out of date, indicating that nightly batch jobs are no longer sufficient.\n\n**Business and Cultural Red Flags:**\n\n**Dashboard Abandonment:**Analysts and business users stop using the BI tool because it's \"too slow.\"**Rising Costs:**Your infrastructure bill is growing faster than the value you're getting from your data, often due to over-provisioning to compensate for poor performance.**Slow Product Velocity:**Engineers spend more time optimizing the database than building features, and product managers can't get timely data to inform their roadmap.\n\nCompanies that see these signs can achieve significant improvements by migrating. **Finqore** reduced 8-hour financial data pipelines to just 8 minutes, while **uDisc** cut query times from minutes to seconds, leading to [a significant lift in daily active analysts](https://motherduck.com/case-studies/).\n\n## How Do I Plan a Migration to MotherDuck?\n\nMigrating to MotherDuck doesn't have to be a massive, disruptive project. You can see value in under 30 days by following a straightforward, phased approach focused on a single, high-pain workload.\n\n### Your 30-Day Migration Roadmap\n\n| Week | Key Tasks | Success Criteria |\n|---|---|---|\nWeek 1: Connect & Ingest | - Create your MotherDuck account and generate service tokens. - Install the DuckDB SDK and connect via `ATTACH 'md:';` . - Perform an initial bulk load of a target dataset (e.g., one large, slow table) into a new MotherDuck database. | - You can successfully query your data in MotherDuck from your local machine and BI tool. - Historical data for one target workload is fully loaded. |\nWeek 2: Mirror a Pilot Workload | - Select one high-pain, low-risk dashboard to migrate. - Set up an incremental CDC pipeline (e.g., using Estuary) to keep MotherDuck in sync with the source. - Re-create the dashboard's data model to point to MotherDuck. | - The mirrored dashboard in MotherDuck is live and updating in near real-time. - p95 query latency is under 2 seconds. |\nWeek 3: Validate & Optimize | - Share the new dashboard with a small group of business users for feedback. - Monitor query performance and cost. - Use optimizations like Read Scaling tokens for the BI tool connection. | - Users confirm the new dashboard is significantly faster and accurate. - The projected cost for the pilot workload is lower than the legacy system. |\nWeek 4: Cut-Over & Expand | - Officially switch all users to the new MotherDuck-powered dashboard. - Decommission the old data models and pipelines for the migrated workload. - Plan the migration of the next set of analytical workloads. | - 100% of users for the pilot workload are using the new dashboard. - A prioritized backlog for the next migration is created. |\n\n## What Are the Limitations of MotherDuck I Should Consider?\n\nNo tool is perfect for every situation. Being honest about limitations is key to making the right choice. MotherDuck is rapidly evolving, but startups should be aware of a few current constraints:\n\n**Regional Availability:**MotherDuck currently operates in the AWS[us-east-1](https://motherduck.com/docs/concepts/architecture-and-capabilities/)and recently started in[eu-central-1](https://motherduck.com/blog/motherduck-in-europe/), hosted in Frankfurt. Teams with strict data residency requirements outside this region will need to consider this.**Partial DuckDB SQL Coverage:**MotherDuck does not yet support the full range of DuckDB's SQL features. Notably, custom Python/native User-Defined Functions (UDFs), server-side`ATTACH`\n\nto other databases (like Postgres), and custom extensions are not yet available. The common workaround is to perform these specific transformations upstream before loading data into MotherDuck.\n\n## Conclusion: Stop Waiting, Start Analyzing\n\nFor a startup, speed is everything: speed to market, speed to insight, and speed of execution. A slow analytics stack is a direct drag on all three. You don't need the complexity and cost of a legacy data warehouse, nor can you afford the performance bottlenecks of an overloaded production database.\n\nMotherDuck offers a third way, purpose-built for the scale and agility of a modern startup. By combining the raw speed of a local-first engine with the on-demand scale of the cloud, it eliminates the trade-offs that have held analytics teams back for years. If your dashboards are slow and your team is frustrated, it's time to evaluate a new approach.\n\n[Ready to experience sub-second analytics? Start building on MotherDuck's free tier today.](https://motherduck.com/startups/)\n\nStart using MotherDuck now!\n\n## FAQS\n\n### How much does MotherDuck cost for a startup?\n\nMotherDuck's pricing is designed for startups. It includes a generous free tier for smaller projects and two pay-as-you-go plans that charge only for storage used and compute-seconds executed. There are no idle cluster charges or minimums, which can lead to [ 70-90% cost savings](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/reduce-cloud-data-warehouse-costs-duckdb-motherduck/) compared to traditional data warehouses.\n\n### Can MotherDuck handle our data volume?\n\nYes. Analysis shows that [over 95% of startup databases are smaller than 1 TB](https://hemantkgupta.medium.com/insight-from-paper-motherduck-duckdb-in-the-cloud-and-in-the-client-e4a73da9dbec), a size range where MotherDuck excels. The hybrid architecture is designed to scale from megabytes on your laptop to tens of terabytes in the cloud, ensuring you have a growth path.\n\n### How does MotherDuck compare to Snowflake or BigQuery for a startup?\n\nWhile large warehouses are powerful, they often come with significant operational complexity and cost overhead that can be burdensome for a startup. MotherDuck offers [a simpler, more cost-effective path](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/modern-data-warehouse-playbook/). Its key differentiators are the serverless, per-second billing model and the unique \"local-first\" hybrid architecture, which provides an excellent development experience and eliminates network latency for many common analytical tasks.\n\n### How do startups decide if MotherDuck fits their analytics stack?\n\nA startup should consider MotherDuck if they experience slow BI dashboards, rising query timeouts, and stale data. It's a strong fit for teams that have outgrown a single database (like PostgreSQL) but want to avoid the cost and complexity of a traditional data warehouse. MotherDuck excels with data volumes from gigabytes to tens of terabytes and is ideal for building fast, interactive analytics without a large data engineering team.\n\n### Why do dashboards struggle when scanning billions of rows?\n\nWhen scanning billions of rows, single-node engines like DuckDB can be constrained by the memory and I/O of a single machine. Complex queries generate large intermediate results that can exceed available RAM, forcing the engine to \"spill\" to a slower disk, which increases latency. High user concurrency can also saturate the CPU, causing all queries to slow down.\n\n### Why do lakehouse architectures often have high query latency?\n\nLakehouse latency is often caused by the **\"small files problem.\"** Streaming jobs write thousands of tiny files to object storage like S3. To run a query, the engine must make many high-latency network requests just to read the metadata and find the right files, adding seconds of delay before the query even starts processing data.\n\n### What are the main causes of slow BI dashboards?\n\nThe primary cause is an architectural mismatch. Startups often run heavy analytical (OLAP) queries on their production (OLTP) database, like PostgreSQL. These row-oriented databases are inefficient for analytics, as they must read entire records instead of just the needed columns. As data grows, this leads to high I/O, slow queries, and dashboard latency.\n\n### How does data modeling impact dashboard performance?\n\nIt has a massive impact. Using a [ star schema](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/star-schema-data-warehouse-guide/), which organizes data into a central \"fact\" table and surrounding \"dimension\" tables, is a proven technique for accelerating analytical queries in columnar databases.",
