# Answer

In MotherDuck, a **database** and a **share** are two distinct but related concepts that serve different purposes in the data warehousing workflow.

## Database

A **MotherDuck database** is a cloud-hosted DuckDB database that you own and control. Key characteristics include:

- **Writable and Modifiable**: You can create tables, insert data, update records, and modify the database structure
- **Full Ownership**: The database belongs to your account, and you have complete control over its contents
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses MotherDuck's Differential Storage system to store data as an ordered sequence of "layers" (snapshots), enabling features like time travel, branching, and efficient zero-copy operations
- **Cloud Catalog Management**: Allows you to manage your DuckDB database catalog in the cloud for easy scaling and collaboration
- **Can be created from local databases**: You can upload a local DuckDB database using `CREATE DATABASE cloud_db FROM local_db`

## Share

A **MotherDuck share** is a read-only, shareable snapshot of a database that can be distributed to other users via a secret URL. Key characteristics include:

- **Read-Only Access**: Recipients can query the data but cannot modify it
- **Snapshot-Based**: A share represents a point-in-time snapshot of the source database that remains synchronized with updates from the original database owner
- **Zero-Copy Creation**: Creating a share is a metadata-only operation (`CREATE SHARE FROM <database>`), meaning no data duplication occurs thanks to the Differential Storage system
- **URL-Based Sharing**: Shares are distributed via a unique URL (e.g., `md:_share/sample_data/...`) that recipients can attach to their MotherDuck session
- **Access Control Options**: Shares can be configured for different access levels - either "anyone with the share link" (including external users) or "restricted to organization members with the share link"
- **Discoverability**: Org-level shares can optionally be made discoverable to all members of an organization, appearing in their "Shared with me" section

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Database | Share |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Ownership** | Owned by creator | Derived from a database |
| **Permissions** | Read/Write | Read-Only |
| **Purpose** | Primary data storage & manipulation | Data distribution & collaboration |
| **Creation** | `CREATE DATABASE` | `CREATE SHARE FROM <database>` |
| **Data Duplication** | Contains actual data | Zero-copy reference to source |
| **Updates** | Direct modifications allowed | Reflects source database updates |

In essence, a database is where you store and work with your data, while a share is how you distribute that data to others for querying without giving them write access or requiring data duplication.
