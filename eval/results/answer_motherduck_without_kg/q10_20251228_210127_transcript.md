│ 💬 QUESTION 10
│ Answer this question by searching through the .kurt/sources/ directory:

...What DuckDB versions does MotherDuck currently support?

Required Steps:
1. Search for relevant markdown files in .kurt/sources/ using glob and grep
2. Read the most relevant files (aim for 3-5 most relevant sources)
3. As you read each file, keep track of:
   - The file path
   - The file title/name
   - Key information extracted from that file
4. Synthesize a comprehensive answer based on the information found
5. Write your answer to: /tmp/answer_without_kg_10.md

IMPORTANT - Your answer MUST have this structure:
```markdown
# Answer

It\u2019s hard not to be excited about supporting a major release, but we are _especially_ excited about this one. We\u2019re thrilled to share that MotherDuck now supports DuckDB version 1.4.1 and DuckLake version 0.3.\n\n**DuckDB 1.4.0** introduced landmark features, including the MERGE statement, VARIANT type, and a completely rewritten sorting engine. **DuckDB 1.4.1** builds on that foundation with important bugfixes and additional improvements. MotherDuck now supports the latest 1.4.1 version. While you can continue using your current version of DuckDB, we encourage you to [upgrade your DuckDB clients to 1.4.1](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=package_manager) as soon as you can.\n\nOn the DuckLake side, MotherDuck now supports **DuckLake 0.3**. DuckLake 0.3 introduces the DuckLake `CHECKPOINT` function that makes table maintenance automatic, plus interoperability with Iceberg and native support for spatial geometry types.\n\nRead on for our favorite highlights from these releases, and check out the DuckDB blogs on [1.4.0](https://duckdb.org/2025/09/16/announcing-duckdb-140.html) and [1.4.1](https://duckdb.org/2025/10/07/announcing-duckdb-141.html) for all the details.\n\n## DuckLake 0.3: Iceberg Interoperability, Simplified Maintenance, and Spatial Data Support\n\n### Iceberg Interoperability\n\nThanks to the DuckDB `iceberg` extension, migrating your Iceberg data lake to MotherDuck-managed DuckLake just got a lot easier. On the migration path, you\u2019ll find an integrated, cloud-scale lakehouse that maintains support for tools that only speak Iceberg.\n\nYou can now copy directly from Iceberg to DuckLake as part of a migration, or from DuckLake to Iceberg to continue using your favorite Iceberg-only tools.\n\n### DuckLake Checkpoint: Maintenance Made Easy\n\nThe new `CHECKPOINT` statement combines all the maintenance operations you need into a single, simple command. Configure it once, and it automatically runs operations in sequential order:\n\n- Flushes inlined data\n- Compacts small files created by multi-threaded writes\n- Rewrites files with many deletions\n- Cleans up orphaned files\n\nNo more juggling multiple maintenance commands\u2014just call `CHECKPOINT` and DuckLake handles the rest:\n\n```sql\nCopy code\n\nATTACH 'ducklake:my_ducklake.ducklake' AS my_ducklake;\nUSE my_ducklake;\nCHECKPOINT;\n```\n\n### Spatial Geometry Types\n\nDuckLake 0.3 introduces native support for geometry data types, allowing users to take advantage of the DuckDB `spatial` extension\u2019s functionality in DuckLake. This opens up powerful new use cases for geospatial analytics directly on your data lake\u2013see the [DuckLake documentation](https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/specification/data_types#geometry-types) for a list of supported types.\n\n### MERGE INTO: Upserts for Data Lakes\n\nDuckLake 0.3 now fully supports the `MERGE INTO` statement, bringing elegant upsert capabilities to your data lake tables without requiring primary keys or indexes. This is a game-changer for incremental data pipelines and slowly changing dimensions.\n\nAs an example:\n\n```sql\nCopy code\n\n-- Update existing records and insert new ones\nWITH new_stocks(item_id, volume) AS (VALUES (20, 2200), (30, 1900))\nMERGE INTO ducklake_table.Stock\nUSING new_stocks USING (item_id)\nWHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET balance = balance + volume\nWHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (new_stocks.item_id, new_stocks.volume)\nRETURNING merge_action, *;\n```\n\n`MERGE` also supports complex conditions and `DELETE` operations, making it perfect for real-world data engineering workflows. `MERGE` operations are efficient and work seamlessly with time travel, versioning, and all other DuckLake features. This gives you OLAP-optimized upsert performance on data lake storage:\n\n```sql\nCopy code\n\nWITH deletes(item_id, delete_threshold) AS (VALUES (10, 3000))\n    MERGE INTO Stock USING deletes USING (item_id)\n    WHEN MATCHED AND balance < delete_threshold THEN DELETE;\nFROM Stock;\n```\n\n### Smarter Write Performance\n\nDuckLake 0.3 speeds up write performance by allowing each thread to write separate files, which can be compacted later using the checkpoint function. This parallelization dramatically improves throughput for bulk inserts while keeping your table organized.\n\n### Additional DuckLake 0.3 Features\n\n- [**Snapshot tracking**](https://github.com/duckdb/ducklake/pull/350): New `current_snapshot()` function for easier snapshot management\n- [**Orphaned file cleanup**](https://github.com/duckdb/ducklake/pull/398): The `ducklake_delete_orphaned_files()` function removes files no longer tracked by DuckLake. Includes a `dry_run` parameter for testing\n- [**Intelligent data file rewriting**](https://github.com/duckdb/ducklake/pull/393) **:** Automatically identifies and rewrites files with many deletions for optimal performance on your current snapshot\n\n## DuckDB 1.4: MERGE Statement, VARIANT Type, and Performance\n\n### MERGE INTO: Upserts Without Primary Keys\n\nDuckDB 1.4.0 adds full support for the `MERGE` statement, giving you a clean, standard SQL way to handle upserts without requiring primary keys or indexes.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```sql\nCopy code\n\nCREATE TABLE Stock(item_id INTEGER, balance INTEGER);\nINSERT INTO Stock VALUES (10, 2200), (20, 1900);\n\nWITH new_stocks(item_id, volume) AS (VALUES (20, 2200), (30, 1900))\n    MERGE INTO Stock\n        USING new_stocks USING (item_id)\n    WHEN MATCHED\n        THEN UPDATE SET balance = balance + volume\n    WHEN NOT MATCHED\n        THEN INSERT VALUES (new_stocks.item_id, new_stocks.volume)\n    RETURNING merge_action, *;\n```\n\n`MERGE` also supports complex conditions and `DELETE` operations, and it works seamlessly with DuckLake 0.3.\n\n### Blazing Fast Sorting: Rewritten from the Ground Up\n\nDuckDB 1.4.0 introduced a completely new sorting implementation that delivers often 2x or better performance improvements while using significantly less memory and scaling better across multiple threads.\n\nThe new k-way merge sort reduces data movement, adapts to pre-sorted data, and powers not just `ORDER BY` clauses but also window functions and list sorting operations. Your most intensive analytical queries just got dramatically faster \u2013 [read the DuckDB blog for more detail](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://duckdb.org/2025/09/24/sorting-again.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1759859043223938&usg=AOvVaw1v0Tkh7BSjXrL6K4duBp19).\n\n## Additional SQL Features\n\n### VARIANT type for semi-structured data\n\nThe new `VARIANT` type provides fast processing of JSON and other semi-structured data, with support for reading `VARIANT` types from Parquet files, including shredded encodings.\n\n### FILL window function for interpolation\n\nThe new `FILL()` window function makes it easy to interpolate missing values:\n\n```sql\nCopy code\n\nFROM (VALUES (1, 1), (2, NULL), (3, 42)) t(c1, c2)\nSELECT fill(c2) OVER (ORDER BY c1) f;\n-- Result: 1, 21, 42\n```\n\n## Huge Thanks to the DuckDB Team and Community\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly _fun_ to work with a technology that improves so fast, and we\u2019re so grateful to the entire DuckDB community. [DuckDB 1.4](https://duckdb.org/2025/09/16/announcing-duckdb-140.html) wouldn't be possible without the outstanding work from the DuckDB team and over 90 contributors who made more than 3,500 commits since version 1.3.2.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about what else shipped in 1.4, head on over to the [DuckDB site](https://duckdb.org/2025/09/16/announcing-duckdb-140.html) and take a gander for yourself.

While Parquet reads are even faster thanks to optimizations around caching, materialization, and read performance, Parquet writes are also faster due to a smarter use of multithreaded exports, improved compression mechanisms, and rowgroup merges.\n\n### Late materialization\n\nDuckDB now [defers fetching columns until absolutely necessary](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/17325), resulting in **3\u201310x faster reads** for queries with `LIMIT`.\n\n### ~15% average speedup on reads\n\nGeneral **read performance is significantly improved** due to [new efficiency scan and filter improvements](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16315), even without late materialization.\n\n### 30%+ faster write throughput\n\nMajor improvements to **multithreaded Parquet export performance** result in [even faster writes](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16243).\n\n### Better compression for large strings\n\nLarge strings can now be [dictionary-compressed](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/17061), resulting in **reduced file sizes** and performance boosts.\n\n### Smarter rowgroup combining\n\n**Smaller rowgroups from multiple threads** are now [merged at the time of write](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/17036), resulting in more efficient Parquet files.\n\n## Performance Wins Big and Small\n\nThe release of 1.3.0 isn\u2019t just about headline features: It also includes performance boosts across the stack, from aggregations and string scans to CTEs, smarter algorithms, lower memory usage, and better parallelism.\n\n### Here are 12 performance highlights that caught our attention:\n\n- [2x faster Top-N for large `LIMIT` queries:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/17141) If you\u2019re working with up to 250K rows, Top N is now faster than sorting!\n\n- [3x fewer memory allocations in aggregations:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16849) Improvements to string hashing and aggregation internals reduce memory pressure and lower contention, leading to more efficient execution of queries like `COUNT(DISTINCT)` at scale.\n\n- [~25% faster performance for large hash table creation:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16301) The parallelism strategy has been refined to avoid excessive task splitting, leading to better memory access patterns and faster hash table initialization during large joins.\n\n- [20x faster `UNNEST` and `UNPIVOT` for small lists:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16210) DuckDB now processes multiple lists at once and eliminates unnecessary copying to deliver better performance for common patterns like unpivoting a few columns.\n\n- [30\u201340% faster `RANGE` based window functions:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16765) Parallelized task processing across hash groups and reduced lock contention during execution now lead to smoother, more efficient performance.\n\n- [7x faster conversion to Python object columns:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16431) Optimized Python object conversion due to skipping intermediate steps to speed up performance for object columns and scalar UDFs.\n\n- [5\u201325% faster LIKE '%text%' and CONTAINS string scans:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16484) Unified and optimized DuckDB\u2019s implementation using `memchr` for early match detection to speed up substring searches across the board.\n\n- [Faster list-of-list creation:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/17063) Improved performance when constructing nested lists, boosting speed for transformation pipelines that rely on complex list structures.\n\n- [Reduced memory contention in hash joins:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16172) Introduced parallel `memset` for initializing large join tables, eliminating single-threaded bottlenecks and improving performance on multi-core systems.\n\n- [Faster recursive CTEs and complex subqueries performance:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/17294) Adopted a new top-down subquery decorrelation strategy, unlocking better optimization for nested queries and improved performance for recursive CTEs.\n\n- [Improved performance and support for JSON-heavy queries:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16729) More parallelism in `UNION ALL` and resolution of multiple JSON edge cases, for better handling.\n\n- [Faster decoding of short FSST compressed strings:](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16508) Optimized decoding for inlined strings by skipping unnecessary copying, resulting in ~15% speedups without performance regressions on longer strings.\n\n\nAll these optimizations add up to one thing: even faster queries without lifting a finger.\n\n## What This Means for MotherDuck Users\n\nIf you're using MotherDuck, DuckDB 1.3 is already live. Your dbt models, dashboards, and notebooks will feel snappier right away.\n\nWhile you can continue using your current version of DuckDB, we encourage you to [upgrade your DuckDB clients to 1.3.0](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=package_manager) as soon as you can to take advantage of the fixes and performance improvements.\n\nCurious what version you\u2019re on? Run this simple query to take a look:\n\n```csharp\nCopy code\n\nSELECT version();\n```\n\n## Huge Thanks to the DuckDB Team\n\nAt MotherDuck, we\u2019re proud to support the best of DuckDB\u2019s powerfully efficient query engine as a managed cloud service so you can easily manage a fleet of DuckDB instances and collaborate with your team. [DuckDB 1.3.0](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/21/announcing-duckdb-130.html) wouldn\u2019t be possible without the incredible engineering work from the DuckDB team and contributors from the broader community and ecosystem.\n\nIf you have feedback or questions, join our [Community Slack](https://slack.motherduck.com/) or reach out directly in the MotherDuck UI or [online](https://motherduck.com/contact-us/product-expert/).

We\u2019re always excited to see how DuckDB pushes the boundaries of performance and usability, and the 1.2 release delivers on both fronts.\n\nWhether you\u2019re crunching CSVs, writing SQL, or optimizing complex queries, DuckDB 1.2 brings major enhancements to help you work more efficiently, and we\u2019re proud to support it from the outset. Our early support for DuckDB 1.2 is possible due to the helpful collaboration with the DuckDB community as we tested and verified the upcoming release.\n\nThis blog highlights key improvements in performance, the SQL experience, CSV handling, and scalability.\n\n## Performance Gains That Matter\n\nPerformance has always been a strength of DuckDB, and 1.2 takes it to new heights. Several core enhancements boost query speed, particularly for common real-world use cases.\n\n### Even Faster Top N Queries\n\nSorting and retrieving the **top N** records in a dataset is a frequent operation in analytics. DuckDB 1.2 now **leverages a heap-based approach** to make Top N queries faster. That means dashboards, ranking reports, and percentile calculations all see noticeable performance gains.\n\n### Long Strings, Now Compressed\n\nIf you work with datasets containing long string values, DuckDB 1.2 introduces **ZSTD-based string compression**, resulting in better compression and faster write speeds. For MotherDuck users, this translates to faster reads and more efficient storage.\n\n### Aggregation Speed-Ups\n\nGrouping and summarizing large datasets is now faster thanks to **partition-aware aggregation** and other **hash table optimizations**. For example, aggregations on Hive-partitioned datasets now benefit from better data locality, leading to major efficiency improvements.\n\n## A Friendlier SQL Experience\n\nDuckDB 1.2 improvements aren\u2019t just about efficiency gains: 1.2 also introduces improvements that make SQL more intuitive and expressive.\n\n### More Expressive Column Selection\n\nNew shorthand syntax makes it easier to select and rename columns on the fly:\n\n- `SELECT * LIKE '%name%'` lets you select only columns matching a pattern\n- `SELECT * RENAME` allows renaming multiple columns inline\n- Column aliases before expressions improve readability, e.g., `SELECT new_col: x + 1, another: x + 2`\n\n### Better Handling of Boolean Aggregations\n\nPreviously, summing a Boolean column required wrapping it in a `CASE WHEN` statement. Now, you can directly sum a Boolean column with `SUM(price > 50)`, making queries both cleaner and faster.\n\n### Improved Auto-Completion and CLI Experience\n\nWriting SQL is easier than ever with a more intelligent autocomplete engine that provides context-aware suggestions. Plus, the DuckDB CLI gets a fresh upgrade with **syntax highlighting and thousands-separator support** for better readability.\n\n## Better CSV Handling and Excel File Support\n\nReading CSV files remains one of the most common tasks in data analysis, and DuckDB 1.2 makes it even faster and more memory-efficient. Compression and filter pushdown optimizations speed up ingestion, while improved error handling makes dealing with messy data smoother than before.\n\nMany enterprises still rely heavily on Excel files and handling them in DuckDB has traditionally been done through the [spatial extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/file_formats/excel_import.html). Although not technically part of DuckDB 1.2, we want to highlight the newly-improved [Excel extension](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-excel), which now provides support for reading and writing Excel files. It works great with MotherDuck's [Dual Execution](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/running-hybrid-queries/) query engine, enabling Excel files to be read on your local DuckDB client and referenced in your SQL queries so you can upload local data to MotherDuck or `JOIN` with MotherDuck tables in the cloud.\n\n## More Robustness & Scalability\n\nReliability matters, and DuckDB 1.2 includes several robustness improvements that directly benefit MotherDuck users:\n\n- **Fixes for concurrent checkpoints**, improving stability under heavy workloads\n- **Better handling of WAL recovery**, ensuring data integrity in case of crashes\n- **Optimistic writes in more scenarios**, reducing contention in high-concurrency environments\n- **Larger-than-memory UPDATEs, DELETEs and Window Functions**, reducing the reliance on memory and enabling working with even larger-sized datasets\n\n## Whats Next?\n\nDuckDB 1.2 brings meaningful improvements across the board, making it faster, friendlier, and more scalable. At MotherDuck, we\u2019re thrilled to see these optimizations in action, delivering even better performance for our users. Whether you're handling CSVs, running analytical queries, or writing SQL with ease, DuckDB 1.2 makes the experience smoother and more powerful.\n\n### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n[Performance Gains That Matter](https://motherduck.com/blog/announcing-duckdb-12-on-motherduck-cdw/#performance-gains-that-matter)\n\n[A Friendlier SQL Experience](https://motherduck.com/blog/announcing-duckdb-12-on-motherduck-cdw/#a-friendlier-sql-experience)\n\n[Better CSV Handling and Excel File Support](https://motherduck.com/blog/announcing-duckdb-12-on-motherduck-cdw/#better-csv-handling-and-excel-file-support)\n\n[More Robustness & Scalability](https://motherduck.com/blog/announcing-duckdb-12-on-motherduck-cdw/#more-robustness-scalability)\n\n[Whats Next?](https://motherduck.com/blog/announcing-duckdb-12-on-motherduck-cdw/#whats-next)\n\nStart using MotherDuck now!\n\n[Try 21 Days Free](https://motherduck.com/get-started/)\n\nGet Started\n\n![blog subscription icon](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fblog-subscription-icon.67ccd5ae.png&w=828&q=75)\n\n### Subscribe to motherduck blog\n\nE-mail\n\nSubscribe to other MotherDuck Updates\n\nSubmit\n\n## PREVIOUS POSTS\n\n[![Local dev and cloud prod for faster dbt development](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2FLocal_Dev_Cloud_Prod_083b07b92e.png&w=3840&q=75)](https://motherduck.com/blog/dual-execution-dbt/)\n\n[2025/01/16 - Jacob Matson](https://motherduck.com/blog/dual-execution-dbt/)\n\n### [Local dev and cloud prod for faster dbt development](https://motherduck.com/blog/dual-execution-dbt)\n\nSpark the Joy of beautiful local development workflows with MotherDuck & dbt\n\n[![Why CSV Files Won\u2019t Die and How DuckDB Conquers Them](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Fcsvwontdie_1_9a8f8b85b5.png&w=3840&q=75)](https://motherduck.com/blog/csv-files-persist-duckdb-solution/)\n\n[2025/02/04 - Mehdi Ouazza](https://motherduck.com/blog/csv-files-persist-duckdb-solution/)\n\n### [Why CSV Files Won\u2019t Die and How DuckDB Conquers Them](https://motherduck.com/blog/csv-files-persist-duckdb-solution)\n\nLearn how you can pragmatically use DuckDB to parse any CSVs\n\n[View all](https://motherduck.com/blog/)\n\nAuthorization Response",

MotherDuck would like to _quackgradulate_ DuckDB and extend our gratitude for all their hard work and support (and enabling all the duck puns)!\n\n## Why DuckDB?\n\nFor database nerds, [there\u2019s much to love about DuckDB](https://motherduck.com/duckdb-book-brief/) \u2014 [performance](https://thenewstack.io/duckdb-in-process-python-analytics-for-not-quite-big-data/), [innovation velocity](https://motherduck.com/blog/six-reasons-duckdb-slaps/), [versatility](https://duckdb.org/faq.html#why-call-it-duckdb), [ease of use](https://www.nikolasgoebel.com/2024/05/28/duckdb-doesnt-need-data.html), [rich and user-friendly SQL](https://duckdb.org/2024/03/01/sql-gymnastics.html), and [extreme portability](https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb.html#portable). Thanks to DuckDB, analytics can run virtually anywhere, liberated from the shackles of complex and expensive distributed systems. As an embedded database, it\u2019s the perfect \u2018Lego\u2019 building block that can snap into any process just by linking in a library.\n\nWhen we first learned about DuckDB two years ago, we loved it so much that we decided to start a company to turn it into a serverless cloud data warehouse. While in retrospect, this seems like an obvious duck to bet on, at the time, DuckDB was relatively unknown outside of database enthusiast and academic circles. But you could tell, even then, that they were onto something \u2014 the elegance of the design and the fervent enthusiasm of their growing user base set it apart from other databases. Moreover, their philosophy about what actually matters in data management systems deeply resonated with us at MotherDuck.\n\nThis turned out to be a prophetic choice. In the two years since we started working together, DuckDB has consistently moved up the rankings in the [DB Engines list](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking%5D). They\u2019ve gone from thousands of monthly downloads to millions. And they\u2019ve gone from being the database nobody has heard of to the one everyone is talking about.\n\n![DB Engines growth chart](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Fimage1_f6daf71258.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWith DuckDB as the key building block, MotherDuck is a [complete set of Legos](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192?gclid=CjwKCAjwjeuyBhBuEiwAJ3vuoU4Ue7BPvmrfhnovXtGvA-5kp27nHkdJs9LXUCaPZjCUCrewdkOiyRoCnuQQAvD_BwE&ef_id=CjwKCAjwjeuyBhBuEiwAJ3vuoU4Ue7BPvmrfhnovXtGvA-5kp27nHkdJs9LXUCaPZjCUCrewdkOiyRoCnuQQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!790!3!!!!x!!!19930801844!&cmp=KAC-INI-GOOGUS-GO-US_GL-EN-RE-SP-BUY-CREATE-MB_ALWAYS_ON-SHOP-BP-PMAX-ALL-CIDNA00000-PMAX-MEDIUM_PRIORITY&gad_source=1), purpose-made for data teams, analytics application developers, and DuckDB users looking to supercharge and extend their favorite database to the cloud.\n\n## DuckDB Labs, Thank You!\n\nWhen we first talked to [Hannes](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/) and [Mark](https://mytherin.github.io/) about bringing DuckDB to the cloud, they were cautiously supportive of the idea. Since then, we\u2019ve built a great working relationship with the DuckDB Labs team to help achieve our shared vision of DuckDB running everywhere. We\u2019ve also created a pioneering model for building a commercial business without stifling open-source independence.\n\nWe at MotherDuck are extending DuckDB beyond its embedded confines by offering [serverless delivery](https://motherduck.com/product/), [secure sharing](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/managing-shared-motherduck-database/) and [access control](https://motherduck.com/docs/authenticating-to-motherduck/), [durable managed storage](https://motherduck.com/docs/architecture-and-capabilities/), [hybrid/dual query execution](https://motherduck.com/cidr-paper/), [a WebAssembly (Wasm) SDK](https://motherduck.com/blog/building-data-applications-with-motherduck/), and more.\n\nCrucially, thanks to the [extensibility hooks](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview.html) DuckDB provides, MotherDuck has been able to run standard DuckDB under the hood.\n\nAs DuckDB marched towards its 1.0 release, we saw DuckDB Labs\u2019 hard work firsthand to production-proof DuckDB. We appreciate the hardening, fuzzing, refactoring, and testing that has made for an impressively stable, flexible, and semantically rich data management system. Frankly, many of MotherDuck\u2019s recent improvements, including version independence and multi-statement transactions, were made possible by DuckDB Labs\u2019 collaborative efforts.\n\nWe could not have picked a better database to work with or a better group of passionate database professionals to partner with. To Hannes, Mark, and the rest of DuckDB Labs, we appreciate your continuous support, determination, and excellence.\n\nWe look forward to celebrating 2.0 and beyond with you!\n\n## DuckDB 1.0 and MotherDuck\n\nToday\u2019s release also marks the first simultaneous launch of MotherDuck with a new DuckDB version. MotherDuck already supports DuckDB 1.0; if you run a query via MotherDuck, it will run on the latest DuckDB version. What makes this possible is **Version Independence**, a feature we quietly enabled a few weeks ago that decouples clients from the version of DuckDB that we run on our servers.\n\nWhen DuckDB ships a new version, we can upgrade all the MotherDuck servers to run it in the cloud. Users don\u2019t need to do anything; they\u2019ll get access to improved performance and bug fixes. While users will need to upgrade their clients to access new features, they can now do so at their convenience.\n\n## PS: Something BIG is Coming Soon\n\nAt MotherDuck, we have also been busy, and we have some exciting news to share with you very soon.\n\nStay tuned!\n\nMeanwhile, if you\u2019re in San Francisco tonight, **June 3rd, at 6:00 pm**, [celebrate with us at our party at 111 Minna](https://motherducking-party-snowflake-summit.eventbrite.com/)\u2026 [we\u2019ll run it back on Tuesday, June 11th](https://motherducking-party-data-ai-summit.eventbrite.com/)!\n\n## Take Flight with MotherDuck\n\n### Cloud SQL Analytics Without the Overhead\n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried MotherDuck, [take flight with a 30-day trial of the Standard Plan](https://motherduck.com/) or paddle [Free Forever for small projects](https://motherduck.com/product/pricing/).\n\n### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n[Why DuckDB?](https://motherduck.com/blog/motherduck-congratulates-duckdb-1.0-release#why-duckdb)\n\n[DuckDB Labs, Thank You!](https://motherduck.com/blog/motherduck-congratulates-duckdb-1.0-release#duckdb-labs-thank-you)\n\n[DuckDB 1.0 and MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/blog/motherduck-congratulates-duckdb-1.0-release#duckdb-10-and-motherduck)\n\n[PS: Something BIG is Coming Soon](https://motherduck.com/blog/motherduck-congratulates-duckdb-1.0-release#ps-something-big-is-coming-soon)\n\n[Take Flight with MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/blog/motherduck-congratulates-duckdb-1.0-release#take-flight-with-motherduck)\n\nStart using MotherDuck now!\n\n[Try 21 Days Free](https://motherduck.com/get-started/)\n\nGet Started\n\n![blog subscription icon](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fblog-subscription-icon.67ccd5ae.png&w=828&q=75)\n\n### Subscribe to motherduck blog\n\nE-mail\n\nSubscribe to other MotherDuck Updates\n\nSubmit\n\n## PREVIOUS POSTS\n\n[![How we Saved 95% on Log Processing with Bacalhau and MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2FBacalhau_blog_e9a1602bb1.png&w=3840&q=75)](https://motherduck.com/blog/log-processing-savings-bacalhau-motherduck/)\n\n[2024/05/08 - Sean M.
