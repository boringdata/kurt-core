# Question Result: What DuckDB versions does MotherDuck currently support?

**Answer File**: /tmp/answer_without_kg_10.md

## Answer
# DuckDB Versions Supported by MotherDuck

Based on the MotherDuck documentation, **MotherDuck currently supports DuckDB version 1.4.1** as of October 2025.

## Current Version Support

- **Server-side**: MotherDuck runs **DuckDB 1.4.1** on their cloud servers
- **Client-side**: Users can connect with any DuckDB client version, but are encouraged to upgrade to 1.4.1 for optimal performance and access to new features

## Version Independence

MotherDuck implemented a feature called **Version Independence** that was first enabled around June 2024 (before the DuckDB 1.0 release). This feature decouples the client version from the server version, meaning:

- When DuckDB ships a new version, MotherDuck can upgrade all servers to run it in the cloud
- Users don't need to immediately upgrade their clients to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes
- Users can upgrade their clients at their convenience to access new SQL features

## Recent Version History

MotherDuck has supported the following major DuckDB versions in 2024-2025:

- **DuckDB 1.4.1** (October 2025) - Current version with MERGE statements, VARIANT type, improved sorting, and Iceberg support
- **DuckDB 1.3.0** (June 2025) - Performance boosts, faster Parquet operations, file caching
- **DuckDB 1.2** (2025) - Improved SQL experience, CSV handling, autocomplete
- **DuckDB 1.1.0/1.1.1** (September 2024) - Supported within 2 days of the 1.1.1 bugfix release
- **DuckDB 1.0** (June 2024) - First simultaneous launch with MotherDuck support on release day

## Recommendation

While users can continue using older DuckDB client versions, MotherDuck encourages upgrading to the latest client version (1.4.1) to take advantage of:
- New SQL syntax and features (MERGE, VARIANT type, TRY() expressions)
- Performance improvements and bug fixes
- Better compatibility with cloud-side query execution
