# The Difference Between a MotherDuck Database and a Share

## MotherDuck Database

A **MotherDuck database** is a fully functional, writable database hosted in the cloud using MotherDuck's managed DuckDB service. Key characteristics include:

- **Writable**: You can create, modify, and delete tables and data
- **Full Control**: Database owners have complete control over the schema and content
- **Collaborative**: Multiple users can simultaneously access with dedicated compute instances ("ducklings") for concurrent queries
- **Cloud Storage**: Database catalog is managed in the cloud for easy scaling and collaboration
- **Local + Cloud**: Can be queried both locally and in the cloud with seamless integration

## MotherDuck Share

A **share** is a **read-only, shareable snapshot** of a MotherDuck database, purpose-built for data collaboration and ad-hoc analytics. Key characteristics include:

- **Read-Only**: Recipients can query the data but cannot modify it
- **Snapshot-Based**: Represents a point-in-time copy of the database
- **Zero-Copy**: Shares are designed as zero-copy clones, avoiding data duplication
- **Controlled Access**: Share creators control who can access the data and when updates are pushed
- **Easy Distribution**: Shares can be attached by others using a simple SQL command

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Database | Share |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Permissions** | Read and write | Read-only |
| **Purpose** | Primary data storage and processing | Data distribution and collaboration |
| **Updates** | Direct modification allowed | Must be updated by creator |
| **Access** | Requires database ownership or permissions | Anyone with the share URL can attach |
| **Data Protection** | Direct access to production data | Isolated snapshot protects production dataset |

## How Shares Work

Creating and using shares is straightforward:

```sql
-- Create a share from a database
CREATE SHARE share_name FROM database_name (ACCESS UNRESTRICTED);

-- Share URL is returned, e.g.:
-- md:_share/database/373594a2-06f7-4c33-814e-cf59028482ca

-- Others can attach the share:
ATTACH 'md:_share/database/373594a2-06f7-4c33-814e-cf59028482ca';

-- When the database owner updates data, they update the share:
UPDATE SHARE share_name;
```

## Use Cases

**Use a Database when:**
- You need to create, update, or delete data
- Building data pipelines or transformations
- Working as part of a team that needs write access
- Managing production datasets

**Use a Share when:**
- Distributing data to external stakeholders or partners
- Providing read-only access for analytics and reporting
- Protecting production data from accidental modifications
- Enabling ad-hoc data exploration without risking data integrity
- Sharing datasets publicly or with specific users
