# Answer

Based on the MotherDuck documentation and guides, there are several SQL features from DuckDB that are not yet supported in MotherDuck:

## 1. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

**Custom Python/Native UDFs do not work on MotherDuck.** This is a significant limitation for users who rely on extending DuckDB's functionality with custom Python code. As explicitly stated in the documentation:

> "User-Defined Functions (UDFs)... are a feature of the local, embedded DuckDB Python library and **do not work on MotherDuck**. The reason is that UDFs require a Python runtime to execute the function's code. MotherDuck is a serverless platform that provides SQL execution but does not run user-provided Python code on its servers."

This means you cannot:
- Register custom Python functions to use in SQL queries on MotherDuck
- Use `con.create_function()` for MotherDuck-executed queries
- Run vectorized scalar Python UDFs on the cloud backend

**Workaround:** Perform UDF-based transformations locally in DuckDB or upstream in your data pipeline before loading data into MotherDuck.

## 2. Server-Side ATTACH to Other Databases

**MotherDuck does not support server-side `ATTACH` commands to other databases like PostgreSQL.** While DuckDB locally can attach to external databases using extensions (e.g., `ATTACH 'dbname=postgres...' AS pg (TYPE postgres)`), this capability is not available for execution on MotherDuck's cloud servers.

This limitation affects users who want to:
- Directly query PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases from within MotherDuck
- Create federated queries that join MotherDuck tables with external database tables on the server side

**Workaround:** You can still use DuckDB's postgres extension locally and join local external database queries with MotherDuck data through the hybrid/dual execution model, or perform ETL to bring external data into MotherDuck.

## 3. Custom Extensions

**Custom DuckDB extensions are not yet available on MotherDuck.** While MotherDuck provides many built-in DuckDB extensions, users cannot install or run their own custom extensions on the MotherDuck cloud platform.

**Workaround:** Perform operations requiring custom extensions on a local DuckDB instance and use MotherDuck for the operations it supports natively.

## Summary of Unsupported Features

| Feature | Status on MotherDuck | Workaround |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Python UDFs | Not supported | Run locally or transform data upstream |
| Native UDFs | Not supported | Run locally or transform data upstream |
| Server-side ATTACH to Postgres/other DBs | Not supported | Use local DuckDB federation or ETL |
| Custom extensions | Not yet available | Use local DuckDB for custom extension operations |

These limitations stem from MotherDuck's serverless architecture, which executes SQL but does not provide a user-configurable runtime environment for arbitrary code execution. The recommended approach is to perform these specific transformations upstream before loading data into MotherDuck, or to leverage DuckDB's local execution capabilities in conjunction with MotherDuck's hybrid/dual execution model.
