  "question": "How does MotherDuck integrate with DuckDB?",
  "answer": "# How MotherDuck Integrates with DuckDB\n\nMotherDuck extends DuckDB to the cloud through a sophisticated integration architecture that maintains full compatibility with the open-source database while adding cloud-scale capabilities.\n\n## Integration Architecture\n\n### Three-Layer System\n\nMotherDuck's integration is built on three core components:\n\n1. **Client Extension**: MotherDuck integrates directly with the DuckDB ecosystem through an extension system. Users can connect their local DuckDB instance to MotherDuck with a simple command, regardless of whether they're working in the CLI, Python, JDBC, or even the browser via WebAssembly.\n\n2. **Compute Layer**: Cloud-based queries are processed by containerized DuckDB instances called \"ducklings.\" These compute resources scale based on user needs, providing the necessary CPU and memory for analytical queries.\n\n3. **Storage Layer**: Instead of DuckDB's native single-writer file format, MotherDuck implements a differential storage system that maps logical database files to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage. This enables concurrent access, database sharing, and time travel capabilities.\n\n### Non-Fork Philosophy\n\nCritically, MotherDuck does not fork DuckDB. Instead, it leverages DuckDB's powerful extension system to add capabilities at multiple layers including the SQL parser, optimizer, and storage interface. This allows MotherDuck to stay current with the latest open-source DuckDB releases and benefit from rapid community innovation.\n\n## Simple Connection\n\nConnecting to MotherDuck from DuckDB requires only a single command:\n\n```sql\nATTACH 'md:';\n```\n\nUsers simply need a MotherDuck token (which can be set as an environment variable) to authenticate. Once connected, the same DuckDB interface works seamlessly across local and cloud environments.\n\n## Dual Execution Model\n\nThe most innovative feature of MotherDuck's integration is **dual execution** - a hybrid query execution strategy where the optimizer intelligently decides whether to run parts of a query locally on the client or remotely in the cloud.\n\n### How It Works\n\n- When all data resides in MotherDuck databases, queries execute entirely in the cloud\n- When queries involve both local and cloud data, the system runs a mix of local and remote operations\n- The optimizer transfers only the necessary intermediate data to complete operations, avoiding needless data movement\n\n### Performance Benefits\n\nBy pushing computation to where the data lives, MotherDuck minimizes network I/O. In demonstrations, querying a 2GB Parquet file on S3 was significantly faster when executed remotely in MotherDuck (25 seconds) compared to a local DuckDB client that had to first download the data (36 seconds).\n\n### Manual Control\n\nUsers can override automatic optimization using the `md_run` parameter:\n- `md_run = 'local'` forces execution on the local client\n- `md_run = 'remote'` forces execution in the MotherDuck cloud\n\n## Local Development, Cloud Production\n\nMotherDuck enables a seamless workflow where developers can:\n\n1. **Develop locally** with lightning-fast feedback cycles at zero cost\n2. **Deploy to cloud** by simply adding \"md:\" to their connection string\n3. **Run identical workloads** in both environments with zero code changes\n\nThis \"local dev, cloud prod\" model ensures what works locally will perform at scale in production.\n\n## Collaboration Features\n\nThe integration transforms DuckDB from a \"single-player\" tool into a collaborative \"multiplayer\" platform:\n\n- **Database Sharing**: Team members can grant query access to their databases without emailing files or managing S3 buckets\n- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple users can query the same datasets simultaneously, each getting their own dedicated \"duckling\" compute instance\n- **Centralized Secret Manager**: Create persistent, encrypted credentials for cloud storage that work across different clients and sessions\n\n## Extension Support\n\nMotherDuck's client extension can run DuckDB in various environments:\n- CLI interfaces\n- Python scripts\n- JDBC connections\n- Web browsers via WebAssembly (used in the MotherDuck UI for client-side processing)\n\nThis flexibility ensures users can work with their preferred tools while seamlessly accessing both local and cloud data.\n\n## Symbiotic Relationship\n\nAs the largest production user of DuckDB, MotherDuck continuously pushes the engine to its limits and contributes enhancements back to the open-source project. This ensures both DuckDB and MotherDuck evolve together, offering a powerful analytical experience from local exploration to cloud-scale production.\n\n---",
