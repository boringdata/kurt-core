# MotherDuck Compute Instance Sizes

MotherDuck offers **5 distinct compute instance types** designed for different workload requirements, following a serverless architecture with per-user tenancy. Each instance type is optimized for specific use cases ranging from lightweight ad-hoc analytics to the most demanding data transformations.

## Available Instance Types

### 1. **Pulse**
The smallest instance designed for lightweight, fully serverless analytics.

**Common use cases:**
- Ad-hoc analytics tasks with datasets in MotherDuck
- Building read-only workloads with high volumes of concurrent users (e.g., customer-facing analytics applications)
- Situations where a larger, dedicated instance is overkill

**Billing:** Per Compute Unit (CU) second, 1 second minimum

**Pricing:**
- Free plan: Up to 10 CU hours
- Lite plan: $0.25 per CU hour
- Business plan: $0.40 per CU hour

### 2. **Standard**
Built for common data warehouse workloads including loads and transforms.

**Common use cases:**
- Typical data engineering tasks like data ingest and dbt transformations
- Running dbt jobs with multiple transformations in parallel
- Building standard data pipelines before moving to production

**Billing:** Per second, 60 second minimum

**Pricing:**
- Lite plan: $1.20 per hour
- Business plan: $1.80 per hour

### 3. **Jumbo**
Designed for larger data warehouse workloads with many transformations or complex aggregations.

**Common use cases:**
- Query complexity, data volume, and transformation counts too high for Standard instances
- Complex joins and aggregations on growing datasets with event stream data or nested JSON
- Workloads requiring faster execution times

**Billing:** Per second, 60 second minimum

**Pricing:**
- Lite plan: Not available
- Business plan: $3.60 per hour

### 4. **Mega**
An extremely large instance for complex transformations that need to be completed quickly.

**Common use cases:**
- Queries too complex or data volumes too high for Jumbo instances
- Weekly jobs that rebuild all tables and must complete in minutes, not hours
- Customers with 10x the data volume of typical users requiring consistent performance

**Billing:** Per second, 5 minute minimum

**Pricing:**
- Business plan only: $10.80 per hour

### 5. **Giga**
The largest instance type for the toughest transformations.

**Common use cases:**
- Extremely complex data workloads that exceed all other instance capabilities
- One-time massive jobs (e.g., restating revenue for 10 years at a large company)
- Growth path beyond Mega for 10x increases in data volume and complexity

**Billing:** Per second, 10 minute minimum

**Pricing:** Contact MotherDuck sales team

## Plan Availability

- **Free Plan:** Pulse only (1 instance type)
- **Lite Plan:** Pulse and Standard (2 instance types)
- **Business Plan:** Pulse, Standard, Jumbo, Mega, and Giga (5 instance types)

## Additional Features

### Read Scaling
Business plan customers can enable up to **16 read-scaling replicas**, each backed by its own instance, for BI dashboards and read-only use cases. This provides additional concurrent query capacity for high-traffic scenarios.

### Per-User Tenancy
MotherDuck's architecture provides each organization member with an isolated instance, enabling individual, user-level configuration and ensuring workload isolation.
