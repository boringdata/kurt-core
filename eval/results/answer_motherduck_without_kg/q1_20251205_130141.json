DuckDB is known for its efficient handling of columnar data formats, which are typically used in data lakehouses and data warehouses. The entities and relationships suggest a focus on modern data architectures like data lakehouses, which often utilize columnar storage formats such as Parquet and ORC for their efficiency in both storage and query performance.\n\nThe document titled \"data-lake-vs-data-warehouse-vs-lakehouse\" likely discusses the advantages of different storage formats in these architectures. Additionally, the \"duckdb-ecosystem-newsletter-february-2025\" might provide insights into the latest developments and best practices for using DuckDB, which would include preferred file formats.\n\nGiven this context, Parquet and ORC are likely the most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck, as they are optimized for analytical queries and are commonly used in environments that leverage DuckDB.",

However, it introduces ORC as an equal alternative without canonical support, and misses the mention of CSV and JSON as simpler alternatives for specific use cases. The answer is well-written and clear, with good explanatory context, but could be more complete in covering the full spectrum of format options mentioned in the canonical answer."
