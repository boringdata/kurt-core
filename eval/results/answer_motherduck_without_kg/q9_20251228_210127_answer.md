# Answer

MotherDuck offers **five compute instance sizes** (called "Ducklings"), designed for different workload requirements:

## Instance Sizes

### 1. Pulse
- **Description**: The smallest instance, perfect for lightweight, fully serverless analytics
- **Use cases**: Ad-hoc analytics tasks, read-only workloads with high volumes of concurrent users (like customer-facing analytics), situations where a larger dedicated instance is overkill
- **Billing**: Per Compute Unit (CU) second, with 1 second minimum
- **Pricing**:
  - Free plan: Up to 10 CU hours included
  - Lite plan: $0.25 per CU hour
  - Business plan: $0.40 per CU hour

### 2. Standard
- **Description**: Built to handle common data warehouse workloads including loads and transforms
- **Use cases**: Typical data engineering tasks like data ingest and dbt transformations, running dbt jobs with multiple parallel transformations, building standard data pipelines before scaling up
- **Billing**: Per second, with 60 second minimum
- **Pricing**:
  - Lite plan: $1.20 per hour
  - Business plan: $1.80 per hour

### 3. Jumbo
- **Description**: For larger data warehouse workloads with many transformations or complex aggregations
- **Use cases**: When query complexity, data volume, and transformations exceed Standard capacity; complex joins and aggregations on growing datasets; event stream data or nested JSON with changing schemas
- **Billing**: Per second, with 60 second minimum
- **Pricing**: Business plan only - $3.60 per hour

### 4. Mega
- **Description**: An extremely large instance for demanding jobs at an even larger scale
- **Use cases**: Queries too complex or data volumes too high for Jumbo in crunch time; weekly jobs that rebuild all tables and must run in minutes, not hours; serving customers with 10x the data volume while maintaining the same performance
- **Billing**: Per second, with 5 minute minimum
- **Pricing**: Business plan only - $10.80 per hour
- **Availability**: Self-serve on the Business plan

### 5. Giga
- **Description**: The largest instances that enable the toughest transformations to run faster
- **Use cases**: Data workloads so complex that nothing else will work; one-time jobs (e.g., restating revenue for the last 10 years); growth path beyond Mega when data volume and complexity grow 10x
- **Billing**: Per second, with 10 minute minimum
- **Pricing**: Business plan only - Contact sales for pricing
- **Availability**: Requires contacting MotherDuck ("quack with us") to request access

## Additional Scaling Options

Beyond instance sizes, MotherDuck also offers:
- **Read Scaling**: Up to 16 read-scaling replicas, each backed by its own instance, for BI dashboards and read-only use cases
- **Per-user Tenancy**: Each user or customer gets their own isolated duckling, which can be individually sized
- **Dual Execution**: Automatically leverages both local (laptop) compute and cloud compute for optimal performance
