# Answer

Based on the MotherDuck documentation, **MotherDuck currently supports DuckDB version 1.4.1**, which is the latest version as of October 2025.

MotherDuck has progressively supported each major DuckDB release:

- **DuckDB 1.0** - Supported since June 2024 (when DuckDB reached its 1.0 milestone)
- **DuckDB 1.2** - Supported since February 2025
- **DuckDB 1.3** - Supported since June 2025
- **DuckDB 1.4.1** - Currently supported (announced October 2025)

A key feature that enables this is **Version Independence**, which MotherDuck introduced to decouple client versions from the server-side DuckDB version. This means:

1. When DuckDB ships a new version, MotherDuck can upgrade all servers to run the latest version in the cloud
2. Users automatically get access to improved performance and bug fixes without taking any action
3. While users can continue using their current local DuckDB client version, MotherDuck encourages upgrading to 1.4.1 to take advantage of all the latest fixes and features

You can check which version you're running with the simple query: `SELECT version();`
