  "question": "What DuckDB versions does MotherDuck currently support?",
  "answer": "# DuckDB Versions Supported by MotherDuck\n\nBased on the MotherDuck documentation, **MotherDuck currently supports DuckDB version 1.4.1** as of October 2025.\n\n## Current Version Support\n\n- **Server-side**: MotherDuck runs **DuckDB 1.4.1** on their cloud servers\n- **Client-side**: Users can connect with any DuckDB client version, but are encouraged to upgrade to 1.4.1 for optimal performance and access to new features\n\n## Version Independence\n\nMotherDuck implemented a feature called **Version Independence** that was first enabled around June 2024 (before the DuckDB 1.0 release). This feature decouples the client version from the server version, meaning:\n\n- When DuckDB ships a new version, MotherDuck can upgrade all servers to run it in the cloud\n- Users don't need to immediately upgrade their clients to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes\n- Users can upgrade their clients at their convenience to access new SQL features\n\n## Recent Version History\n\nMotherDuck has supported the following major DuckDB versions in 2024-2025:\n\n- **DuckDB 1.4.1** (October 2025) - Current version with MERGE statements, VARIANT type, improved sorting, and Iceberg support\n- **DuckDB 1.3.0** (June 2025) - Performance boosts, faster Parquet operations, file caching\n- **DuckDB 1.2** (2025) - Improved SQL experience, CSV handling, autocomplete\n- **DuckDB 1.1.0/1.1.1** (September 2024) - Supported within 2 days of the 1.1.1 bugfix release\n- **DuckDB 1.0** (June 2024) - First simultaneous launch with MotherDuck support on release day\n\n## Recommendation\n\nWhile users can continue using older DuckDB client versions, MotherDuck encourages upgrading to the latest client version (1.4.1) to take advantage of:\n- New SQL syntax and features (MERGE, VARIANT type, TRY() expressions)\n- Performance improvements and bug fixes\n- Better compatibility with cloud-side query execution\n\nYou can check your current DuckDB version by running:\n```sql\nSELECT version();\n```",

    "feedback": "The generated answer is mostly accurate and provides a comprehensive overview of the supported DuckDB versions, but it includes excessive detail that may not be relevant to the question. While it is clear and well-structured, it could be improved by focusing more on the current support status and less on historical context. The accuracy score reflects the factual correctness, while the completeness score acknowledges the thoroughness of the information provided. The relevance score is lower due to the inclusion of extraneous details."
