        "stdout": "MotherDuck offers **five compute instance sizes** (called \"Ducklings\"), designed for different workload requirements:\n\n## Instance Sizes\n\n### 1. Pulse\n- **Description**: The smallest instance, perfect for lightweight, fully serverless analytics\n- **Use cases**: Ad-hoc analytics tasks, read-only workloads with high volumes of concurrent users (like customer-facing analytics), situations where a larger dedicated instance is overkill\n- **Billing**: Per Compute Unit (CU) second, with 1 second minimum\n- **Pricing**:\n  - Free plan: Up to 10 CU hours included\n  - Lite plan: $0.25 per CU hour\n  - Business plan: $0.40 per CU hour\n\n### 2. Standard\n- **Description**: Built to handle common data warehouse workloads including loads and transforms\n- **Use cases**: Typical data engineering tasks like data ingest and dbt transformations, running dbt jobs with multiple parallel transformations, building standard data pipelines before scaling up\n- **Billing**: Per second, with 60 second minimum\n- **Pricing**:\n  - Lite plan: $1.20 per hour\n  - Business plan: $1.80 per hour\n\n### 3. Jumbo\n- **Description**: For larger data warehouse workloads with many transformations or complex aggregations\n- **Use cases**: When query complexity, data volume, and transformations exceed Standard capacity; complex joins and aggregations on growing datasets; event stream data or nested JSON with changing schemas\n- **Billing**: Per second, with 60 second minimum\n- **Pricing**: Business plan only - $3.60 per hour\n\n### 4. Mega\n- **Description**: An extremely large instance for demanding jobs at an even larger scale\n- **Use cases**: Queries too complex or data volumes too high for Jumbo in crunch time; weekly jobs that rebuild all tables and must run in minutes, not hours; serving customers with 10x the data volume while maintaining the same performance\n- **Billing**: Per second, with 5 minute minimum\n- **Pricing**: Business plan only - $10.80 per hour\n- **Availability**: Self-serve on the Business plan\n\n### 5. Giga\n- **Description**: The largest instances that enable the toughest transformations to run faster\n- **Use cases**: Data workloads so complex that nothing else will work; one-time jobs (e.g., restating revenue for the last 10 years); growth path beyond Mega when data volume and complexity grow 10x\n- **Billing**: Per second, with 10 minute minimum\n- **Pricing**: Business plan only - Contact sales for pricing\n- **Availability**: Requires contacting MotherDuck (\"quack with us\") to request access\n\n## Plan Availability\n\n| Instance Type | Free Plan | Lite Plan | Business Plan |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| Pulse         | \u2713         | \u2713         | \u2713             |\n| Standard      | \u2713         | \u2713         | \u2713             |\n| Jumbo         | -         | -         | \u2713             |\n| Mega          | -         | -         | \u2713             |\n| Giga          | -         | -         | \u2713 (by request)|\n\n## Additional Scaling Options\n\nBeyond instance sizes, MotherDuck also offers:\n- **Read Scaling**: Up to 16 read-scaling replicas, each backed by its own instance, for BI dashboards and read-only use cases\n- **Per-user Tenancy**: Each user or customer gets their own isolated duckling, which can be individually sized\n- **Dual Execution**: Automatically leverages both local (laptop) compute and cloud compute for optimal performance",

The canonical answer explicitly states that MotherDuck does NOT offer fixed instance sizes but instead uses serverless compute with dynamic resource allocation. The generated answer contradicts this by describing five specific instance types with fixed pricing, which appears to be incorrect information about MotherDuck's actual architecture. While the answer is comprehensive and well-structured, it fails on accuracy - the most important dimension for a factual question."
