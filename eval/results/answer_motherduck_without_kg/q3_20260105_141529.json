        "stdout": "The most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck are, in order of efficiency:\n\n## 1. Apache Parquet (Most Efficient)\n\n**Parquet is the recommended format** for loading data into MotherDuck due to its columnar storage design that aligns perfectly with DuckDB's analytical engine. Key efficiency benefits include:\n\n- **Superior compression**: Parquet uses specialized encoding techniques (dictionary encoding, run-length encoding, delta encoding) that reduce storage footprint by storing similar data types together\n- **Reduced I/O**: Only reads columns needed for a query rather than entire rows - if your query needs 2 columns out of 100, a columnar system might only read 2% of the total data\n- **Predicate pushdown and column pruning**: MotherDuck's query engine pushes down filters to the file level, minimizing data read from cloud storage and reducing costs\n- **Native integration**: DuckDB's architecture is \"purpose-built to leverage the column-oriented design of Parquet,\" enabling seamless data processing with minimal overhead\n- **Rich metadata**: Parquet files store statistics (min/max values, null counts) for each column chunk, enabling data skipping optimizations\n\n## 2. CSV Files\n\nWhile less efficient than Parquet, CSV files are well-supported with DuckDB's exceptional CSV parser:\n\n- **Auto-detection**: DuckDB's `read_csv_auto` function automatically infers column names, data types, and file dialects\n- **Schema-on-read**: No need to write `CREATE TABLE` statements - query CSV files directly\n- **Error handling**: Options like `ignore_errors`, `store_rejects`, and `null_padding` handle messy data gracefully\n- **Glob patterns**: Query multiple files at once with wildcards (e.g., `'s3://my-bucket/logs/2025/**/*.csv'`)\n- **Benchmark performance**: DuckDB ranked #1 on the Pollock benchmark for CSV parsing, correctly reading 99.61% of data across problematic test files\n\n**When CSV makes sense**: Universal compatibility, easy to edit/read, and still common for data exchange from CRMs, social media exports, and financial systems.\n\n## 3. JSON Files\n\nJSON is supported but less efficient than columnar formats:\n\n- **Auto-detection**: `read_json_auto` infers schema, representing nested objects as `STRUCT`s and arrays as `LIST`s\n- **Nested data support**: Use `unnest` function and dot notation to access nested values\n- **Direct API queries**: Can parse JSON directly from web APIs\n- **Best for**: Semi-structured data with varying schemas, API responses, and log files\n\n## Efficiency Comparison Summary\n\n| Format | Compression | Query Performance | Best Use Case |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Parquet** | Excellent (columnar) | Fastest (column pruning, predicate pushdown) | Analytics, large datasets, cloud storage |\n| **CSV** | None | Good with auto-detection | Data exchange, quick imports, universal compatibility |\n| **JSON** | None | Moderate (nested parsing overhead) | Semi-structured data, API data, logs |\n\n## Additional Table Formats\n\nFor advanced use cases, MotherDuck also supports:\n\n- **Apache Iceberg**: Provides transactional guarantees, time travel, and schema evolution on top of Parquet files\n- **Delta Lake**: Similar to Iceberg with ACID transactions and data versioning\n- **DuckLake**: MotherDuck's native table format with modern architecture\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\n1. **Convert CSV to Parquet** when possible for repeated analytical queries - DuckDB makes this trivial with `COPY TO` statements\n2. **Use glob patterns** to query multiple files as a single table: `read_parquet('s3://bucket/**/*.parquet')`\n3. **Leverage Hive-style partitioning** (e.g., `/year=2025/month=10/`) to enable partition pruning and reduce scan costs\n4. **For cloud storage**: Parquet's compression and columnar design significantly reduces network transfer costs",

JSON Files\n\nJSON is supported but less efficient than columnar formats:\n\n- **Auto-detection**: `read_json_auto` infers schema, representing nested objects as `STRUCT`s and arrays as `LIST`s\n- **Nested data support**: Use `unnest` function and dot notation to access nested values\n- **Direct API queries**: Can parse JSON directly from web APIs\n- **Best for**: Semi-structured data with varying schemas, API responses, and log files\n\n## Efficiency Comparison Summary\n\n| Format | Compression | Query Performance | Best Use Case |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Parquet** | Excellent (columnar) | Fastest (column pruning, predicate pushdown) | Analytics, large datasets, cloud storage |\n| **CSV** | None | Good with auto-detection | Data exchange, quick imports, universal compatibility |\n| **JSON** | None | Moderate (nested parsing overhead) | Semi-structured data, API data, logs |\n\n## Additional Table Formats\n\nFor advanced use cases, MotherDuck also supports:\n\n- **Apache Iceberg**: Provides transactional guarantees, time travel, and schema evolution on top of Parquet files\n- **Delta Lake**: Similar to Iceberg with ACID transactions and data versioning\n- **DuckLake**: MotherDuck's native table format with modern architecture\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\n1. **Convert CSV to Parquet** when possible for repeated analytical queries - DuckDB makes this trivial with `COPY TO` statements\n2. **Use glob patterns** to query multiple files as a single table: `read_parquet('s3://bucket/**/*.parquet')`\n3. **Leverage Hive-style partitioning** (e.g., `/year=2025/month=10/`) to enable partition pruning and reduce scan costs\n4. **For cloud storage**: Parquet's compression and columnar design significantly reduces network transfer costs\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/why-choose-parquet-table-file-format.md - Comprehensive guide on Parquet format benefits, columnar storage advantages, compression techniques, and DuckDB integration\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/csv-files-persist-duckdb-solution.md - Details on DuckDB's CSV parser capabilities, loading multiple CSVs, and practical examples with Stack Overflow data\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/no-etl-query-raw-files.md - No-ETL approach for querying CSV, JSON, and Parquet files directly; glob patterns; handling messy data; cloud storage integration\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/columnar-storage-guide.md - In-depth explanation of columnar vs row-oriented storage, compression methods, vectorized execution, and Parquet as the standard format\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/taming-wild-csvs-with-duckdb-data-engineering.md - Advanced CSV handling techniques including sniff_csv, error handling options, union_by_name for inconsistent schemas, and Pollock benchmark results\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/analyze-json-data-using-sql.md - Guide on querying JSON files with DuckDB, handling nested data, using unnest function, and importing JSON into tables\n"

              "content": "# Answer\n\nMotherDuck integrates with DuckDB through a sophisticated architecture that extends DuckDB's capabilities without forking the open-source project. Here's how the integration works:\n\n## Extension-Based Integration\n\nMotherDuck uses DuckDB's powerful **extension system** to add cloud capabilities at multiple layers, including the SQL parser, optimizer, and storage interface. The MotherDuck extension is built directly into DuckDB and allows users to connect their local DuckDB instance to the MotherDuck cloud service with a simple `ATTACH` command. This approach means users automatically benefit from the rapid innovation of the DuckDB community almost immediately.\n\n## Three-Layer Architecture\n\nThe integration is built on three main components:\n\n1. **The Client Extension**: This is how MotherDuck integrates with the DuckDB ecosystem. Whether a user is working in the CLI, a Python script, or a JDBC connection, a simple command connects their local DuckDB instance to the MotherDuck cloud. This extension even enables running DuckDB in the browser via WASM for the MotherDuck UI.\n\n2. **The Compute Layer**: In the cloud, queries are processed by containerized DuckDB instances (called \"ducklings\"). These compute resources scale based on user needs, providing necessary CPU and memory for complex analytical queries.\n\n3. **The Storage Layer**: MotherDuck implemented a differential storage system that maps a logical database file to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage. This enables features like database sharing and time travel.\n\n## Dual Execution Model\n\nThe most innovative feature is **dual execution** (also called hybrid execution). This is a hybrid query execution strategy where the optimizer intelligently decides whether to run parts of a query locally on the client or remotely in the MotherDuck cloud. The primary goal is to minimize data movement and leverage compute where it makes the most sense.\n\nFor example, when a query joins local data with cloud data:\n- Local files are scanned and processed on the user's machine\n- Cloud tables are scanned remotely on MotherDuck's compute\n- The system efficiently transfers only the necessary intermediate data to complete the join\n- Users can override execution location with the `md_run` parameter (`'local'` or `'remote'`)\n\n## Key Benefits of the Integration\n\n- **Seamless Connection**: Any DuckDB instance running in Python or CLI can connect to MotherDuck with a single line of code\n- **Same Engine**: MotherDuck uses the exact same DuckDB engine both locally and in the cloud, ensuring query consistency\n- **Database Sharing**: Teams can share databases and collaborate on a single source of truth\n- **Centralized Secret Manager**: Secure credential management for accessing external data sources like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Delta Lake\n- **Browser-Based Access**: DuckDB runs via WASM in the MotherDuck web UI, enabling client-side processing\n\n## Symbiotic Relationship\n\nMotherDuck is the largest production user of DuckDB and continuously pushes the engine to its limits, uncovering opportunities for improvement and contributing enhancements back to the open-source project. This collaboration ensures both DuckDB and MotherDuck continue to evolve together.\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/videos/bringing-duckdb-to-the-cloud-dual-execution-explained.md - Detailed explanation of dual execution architecture, three-layer system (client extension, compute layer, storage layer), and how MotherDuck extends DuckDB without forking\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/what-is-duckdb.md - Background on DuckDB as an embeddable OLAP database and its relationship to MotherDuck as a cloud data warehouse built on DuckDB\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/announcing-motherduck-duckdb-in-the-cloud.md - Announcement of hybrid execution capabilities, showing how local and cloud data can be joined in a single query\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/hybrid-analytics-guide.md - Comprehensive guide on dual execution, how it minimizes data transfer, and the benefits for data engineers\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/glossary/MotherDuck extension.md - Description of the MotherDuck extension that enables seamless integration between local DuckDB and MotherDuck cloud service\n"

              "content": "# Answer\n\nBased on the MotherDuck documentation, there are several SQL features from DuckDB that are not yet supported in MotherDuck:\n\n## 1. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)\n\nCustom Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) **do not work on MotherDuck**. The documentation explicitly states: \"UDFs, as described in this section, are a feature of the local, embedded DuckDB Python library and **do not work on MotherDuck**. The reason is that UDFs require a Python runtime to execute the function's code. MotherDuck is a serverless platform that provides SQL execution but does not run user-provided Python code on its servers.\"\n\nThis means that while you can create and use Python UDFs when running DuckDB locally (using `con.create_function()`), these functions cannot be executed on MotherDuck's cloud infrastructure.\n\n## 2. Server-Side ATTACH to External Databases\n\nMotherDuck does not yet support server-side `ATTACH` to other databases like PostgreSQL. This means you cannot directly connect to external database systems from within MotherDuck's cloud environment.\n\n## 3. Custom Extensions\n\nCustom DuckDB extensions are not yet available on MotherDuck. While DuckDB has a rich extension ecosystem that allows adding capabilities at multiple layers (SQL parser, optimizer, storage interface), custom or third-party extensions cannot be installed on MotherDuck's serverless platform.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThe documentation suggests a common workaround for these limitations: \"perform these specific transformations upstream before loading data into MotherDuck.\" This means handling UDF-based transformations, external database connections, and extension-dependent operations in your local DuckDB environment or ETL pipeline before loading the processed data into MotherDuck.\n\n## Additional DuckDB Limitations (Present in Both DuckDB and MotherDuck)\n\nIt's worth noting that some SQL features are not supported in DuckDB itself (and therefore also unavailable in MotherDuck):\n\n- **ALTER TABLE limitations**: DuckDB does not support `ADD CONSTRAINT` and `DROP CONSTRAINT` in `ALTER TABLE` statements. Constraints must be defined during initial table creation.\n- **ALTER TABLE column type changes**: Unlike PostgreSQL, DuckDB's `ALTER TABLE` doesn't support changing column data types, adding or removing constraints, or modifying default values of existing columns directly.\n- **SERIAL/AUTO_INCREMENT**: DuckDB does not support the `SERIAL` type or simple `AUTOINCREMENT` keywords. Instead, you must use sequences with `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `DEFAULT nextval('sequence_name')`.\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/fix-slow-bi-dashboards.md - Key information about MotherDuck limitations including: custom Python/native UDFs not supported, server-side ATTACH to other databases not available, and custom extensions not yet available\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/duckdb-python-quickstart-part2.md - Detailed explanation that Python UDFs are a feature of local DuckDB only and \"do not work on MotherDuck\" because MotherDuck is a serverless platform that doesn't run user-provided Python code\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/glossary/ALTER TABLE statement.md - Information about DuckDB's limited ALTER TABLE functionality compared to PostgreSQL (no support for changing column data types, adding/removing constraints)\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/acid-transactions-sql.md - Confirmation that DuckDB does not support ADD CONSTRAINT and DROP CONSTRAINT in ALTER TABLE statements\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/star-schema-data-warehouse-guide.md - Information about DuckDB not supporting SERIAL type or AUTOINCREMENT keywords, requiring sequences instead\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/videos/bringing-duckdb-to-the-cloud-dual-execution-explained.md - Background on MotherDuck's architecture and extension system\n"

              "content": "# Answer\n\nThe most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck are, in order of efficiency:\n\n## 1. Apache Parquet (Most Efficient)\n\n**Parquet is the recommended format** for loading data into MotherDuck due to its columnar storage design that aligns perfectly with DuckDB's analytical engine. Key efficiency benefits include:\n\n- **Superior compression**: Parquet uses specialized encoding techniques (dictionary encoding, run-length encoding, delta encoding) that reduce storage footprint by storing similar data types together\n- **Reduced I/O**: Only reads columns needed for a query rather than entire rows - if your query needs 2 columns out of 100, a columnar system might only read 2% of the total data\n- **Predicate pushdown and column pruning**: MotherDuck's query engine pushes down filters to the file level, minimizing data read from cloud storage and reducing costs\n- **Native integration**: DuckDB's architecture is \"purpose-built to leverage the column-oriented design of Parquet,\" enabling seamless data processing with minimal overhead\n- **Rich metadata**: Parquet files store statistics (min/max values, null counts) for each column chunk, enabling data skipping optimizations\n\n## 2. CSV Files\n\nWhile less efficient than Parquet, CSV files are well-supported with DuckDB's exceptional CSV parser:\n\n- **Auto-detection**: DuckDB's `read_csv_auto` function automatically infers column names, data types, and file dialects\n- **Schema-on-read**: No need to write `CREATE TABLE` statements - query CSV files directly\n- **Error handling**: Options like `ignore_errors`, `store_rejects`, and `null_padding` handle messy data gracefully\n- **Glob patterns**: Query multiple files at once with wildcards (e.g., `'s3://my-bucket/logs/2025/**/*.csv'`)\n- **Benchmark performance**: DuckDB ranked #1 on the Pollock benchmark for CSV parsing, correctly reading 99.61% of data across problematic test files\n\n**When CSV makes sense**: Universal compatibility, easy to edit/read, and still common for data exchange from CRMs, social media exports, and financial systems.\n\n## 3. JSON Files\n\nJSON is supported but less efficient than columnar formats:\n\n- **Auto-detection**: `read_json_auto` infers schema, representing nested objects as `STRUCT`s and arrays as `LIST`s\n- **Nested data support**: Use `unnest` function and dot notation to access nested values\n- **Direct API queries**: Can parse JSON directly from web APIs\n- **Best for**: Semi-structured data with varying schemas, API responses, and log files\n\n## Efficiency Comparison Summary\n\n| Format | Compression | Query Performance | Best Use Case |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Parquet** | Excellent (columnar) | Fastest (column pruning, predicate pushdown) | Analytics, large datasets, cloud storage |\n| **CSV** | None | Good with auto-detection | Data exchange, quick imports, universal compatibility |\n| **JSON** | None | Moderate (nested parsing overhead) | Semi-structured data, API data, logs |\n\n## Additional Table Formats\n\nFor advanced use cases, MotherDuck also supports:\n\n- **Apache Iceberg**: Provides transactional guarantees, time travel, and schema evolution on top of Parquet files\n- **Delta Lake**: Similar to Iceberg with ACID transactions and data versioning\n- **DuckLake**: MotherDuck's native table format with modern architecture\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\n1. **Convert CSV to Parquet** when possible for repeated analytical queries - DuckDB makes this trivial with `COPY TO` statements\n2. **Use glob patterns** to query multiple files as a single table: `read_parquet('s3://bucket/**/*.parquet')`\n3. **Leverage Hive-style partitioning** (e.g., `/year=2025/month=10/`) to enable partition pruning and reduce scan costs\n4. **For cloud storage**: Parquet's compression and columnar design significantly reduces network transfer costs\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/why-choose-parquet-table-file-format.md - Comprehensive guide on Parquet format benefits, columnar storage advantages, compression techniques, and DuckDB integration\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/csv-files-persist-duckdb-solution.md - Details on DuckDB's CSV parser capabilities, loading multiple CSVs, and practical examples with Stack Overflow data\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/no-etl-query-raw-files.md - No-ETL approach for querying CSV, JSON, and Parquet files directly; glob patterns; handling messy data; cloud storage integration\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/columnar-storage-guide.md - In-depth explanation of columnar vs row-oriented storage, compression methods, vectorized execution, and Parquet as the standard format\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/taming-wild-csvs-with-duckdb-data-engineering.md - Advanced CSV handling techniques including sniff_csv, error handling options, union_by_name for inconsistent schemas, and Pollock benchmark results\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/analyze-json-data-using-sql.md - Guide on querying JSON files with DuckDB, handling nested data, using unnest function, and importing JSON into tables\n"

              "content": "# Answer\n\nMotherDuck integrates with DuckDB through a sophisticated architecture that extends DuckDB's capabilities without forking the open-source project. Here's how the integration works:\n\n## Extension-Based Integration\n\nMotherDuck uses DuckDB's powerful **extension system** to add cloud capabilities at multiple layers, including the SQL parser, optimizer, and storage interface. The MotherDuck extension is built directly into DuckDB and allows users to connect their local DuckDB instance to the MotherDuck cloud service with a simple `ATTACH` command. This approach means users automatically benefit from the rapid innovation of the DuckDB community almost immediately.\n\n## Three-Layer Architecture\n\nThe integration is built on three main components:\n\n1. **The Client Extension**: This is how MotherDuck integrates with the DuckDB ecosystem. Whether a user is working in the CLI, a Python script, or a JDBC connection, a simple command connects their local DuckDB instance to the MotherDuck cloud. This extension even enables running DuckDB in the browser via WASM for the MotherDuck UI.\n\n2. **The Compute Layer**: In the cloud, queries are processed by containerized DuckDB instances (called \"ducklings\"). These compute resources scale based on user needs, providing necessary CPU and memory for complex analytical queries.\n\n3. **The Storage Layer**: MotherDuck implemented a differential storage system that maps a logical database file to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage. This enables features like database sharing and time travel.\n\n## Dual Execution Model\n\nThe most innovative feature is **dual execution** (also called hybrid execution). This is a hybrid query execution strategy where the optimizer intelligently decides whether to run parts of a query locally on the client or remotely in the MotherDuck cloud. The primary goal is to minimize data movement and leverage compute where it makes the most sense.\n\nFor example, when a query joins local data with cloud data:\n- Local files are scanned and processed on the user's machine\n- Cloud tables are scanned remotely on MotherDuck's compute\n- The system efficiently transfers only the necessary intermediate data to complete the join\n- Users can override execution location with the `md_run` parameter (`'local'` or `'remote'`)\n\n## Key Benefits of the Integration\n\n- **Seamless Connection**: Any DuckDB instance running in Python or CLI can connect to MotherDuck with a single line of code\n- **Same Engine**: MotherDuck uses the exact same DuckDB engine both locally and in the cloud, ensuring query consistency\n- **Database Sharing**: Teams can share databases and collaborate on a single source of truth\n- **Centralized Secret Manager**: Secure credential management for accessing external data sources like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Delta Lake\n- **Browser-Based Access**: DuckDB runs via WASM in the MotherDuck web UI, enabling client-side processing\n\n## Symbiotic Relationship\n\nMotherDuck is the largest production user of DuckDB and continuously pushes the engine to its limits, uncovering opportunities for improvement and contributing enhancements back to the open-source project. This collaboration ensures both DuckDB and MotherDuck continue to evolve together.\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/videos/bringing-duckdb-to-the-cloud-dual-execution-explained.md - Detailed explanation of dual execution architecture, three-layer system (client extension, compute layer, storage layer), and how MotherDuck extends DuckDB without forking\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/what-is-duckdb.md - Background on DuckDB as an embeddable OLAP database and its relationship to MotherDuck as a cloud data warehouse built on DuckDB\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/announcing-motherduck-duckdb-in-the-cloud.md - Announcement of hybrid execution capabilities, showing how local and cloud data can be joined in a single query\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/hybrid-analytics-guide.md - Comprehensive guide on dual execution, how it minimizes data transfer, and the benefits for data engineers\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/glossary/MotherDuck extension.md - Description of the MotherDuck extension that enables seamless integration between local DuckDB and MotherDuck cloud service\n"

User-Defined Functions (UDFs)\n\nCustom Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) **do not work on MotherDuck**. The documentation explicitly states: \"UDFs, as described in this section, are a feature of the local, embedded DuckDB Python library and **do not work on MotherDuck**. The reason is that UDFs require a Python runtime to execute the function's code. MotherDuck is a serverless platform that provides SQL execution but does not run user-provided Python code on its servers.\"\n\nThis means that while you can create and use Python UDFs when running DuckDB locally (using `con.create_function()`), these functions cannot be executed on MotherDuck's cloud infrastructure.\n\n## 2. Server-Side ATTACH to External Databases\n\nMotherDuck does not yet support server-side `ATTACH` to other databases like PostgreSQL. This means you cannot directly connect to external database systems from within MotherDuck's cloud environment.\n\n## 3. Custom Extensions\n\nCustom DuckDB extensions are not yet available on MotherDuck. While DuckDB has a rich extension ecosystem that allows adding capabilities at multiple layers (SQL parser, optimizer, storage interface), custom or third-party extensions cannot be installed on MotherDuck's serverless platform.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThe documentation suggests a common workaround for these limitations: \"perform these specific transformations upstream before loading data into MotherDuck.\" This means handling UDF-based transformations, external database connections, and extension-dependent operations in your local DuckDB environment or ETL pipeline before loading the processed data into MotherDuck.\n\n## Additional DuckDB Limitations (Present in Both DuckDB and MotherDuck)\n\nIt's worth noting that some SQL features are not supported in DuckDB itself (and therefore also unavailable in MotherDuck):\n\n- **ALTER TABLE limitations**: DuckDB does not support `ADD CONSTRAINT` and `DROP CONSTRAINT` in `ALTER TABLE` statements. Constraints must be defined during initial table creation.\n- **ALTER TABLE column type changes**: Unlike PostgreSQL, DuckDB's `ALTER TABLE` doesn't support changing column data types, adding or removing constraints, or modifying default values of existing columns directly.\n- **SERIAL/AUTO_INCREMENT**: DuckDB does not support the `SERIAL` type or simple `AUTOINCREMENT` keywords. Instead, you must use sequences with `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `DEFAULT nextval('sequence_name')`.\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/fix-slow-bi-dashboards.md - Key information about MotherDuck limitations including: custom Python/native UDFs not supported, server-side ATTACH to other databases not available, and custom extensions not yet available\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/duckdb-python-quickstart-part2.md - Detailed explanation that Python UDFs are a feature of local DuckDB only and \"do not work on MotherDuck\" because MotherDuck is a serverless platform that doesn't run user-provided Python code\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/glossary/ALTER TABLE statement.md - Information about DuckDB's limited ALTER TABLE functionality compared to PostgreSQL (no support for changing column data types, adding/removing constraints)\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/acid-transactions-sql.md - Confirmation that DuckDB does not support ADD CONSTRAINT and DROP CONSTRAINT in ALTER TABLE statements\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/star-schema-data-warehouse-guide.md - Information about DuckDB not supporting SERIAL type or AUTOINCREMENT keywords, requiring sequences instead\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/videos/bringing-duckdb-to-the-cloud-dual-execution-explained.md - Background on MotherDuck's architecture and extension system\n"

              "content": "# Answer\n\nThe most efficient file formats for loading data into MotherDuck are, in order of efficiency:\n\n## 1. Apache Parquet (Most Efficient)\n\n**Parquet is the recommended format** for loading data into MotherDuck due to its columnar storage design that aligns perfectly with DuckDB's analytical engine. Key efficiency benefits include:\n\n- **Superior compression**: Parquet uses specialized encoding techniques (dictionary encoding, run-length encoding, delta encoding) that reduce storage footprint by storing similar data types together\n- **Reduced I/O**: Only reads columns needed for a query rather than entire rows - if your query needs 2 columns out of 100, a columnar system might only read 2% of the total data\n- **Predicate pushdown and column pruning**: MotherDuck's query engine pushes down filters to the file level, minimizing data read from cloud storage and reducing costs\n- **Native integration**: DuckDB's architecture is \"purpose-built to leverage the column-oriented design of Parquet,\" enabling seamless data processing with minimal overhead\n- **Rich metadata**: Parquet files store statistics (min/max values, null counts) for each column chunk, enabling data skipping optimizations\n\n## 2. CSV Files\n\nWhile less efficient than Parquet, CSV files are well-supported with DuckDB's exceptional CSV parser:\n\n- **Auto-detection**: DuckDB's `read_csv_auto` function automatically infers column names, data types, and file dialects\n- **Schema-on-read**: No need to write `CREATE TABLE` statements - query CSV files directly\n- **Error handling**: Options like `ignore_errors`, `store_rejects`, and `null_padding` handle messy data gracefully\n- **Glob patterns**: Query multiple files at once with wildcards (e.g., `'s3://my-bucket/logs/2025/**/*.csv'`)\n- **Benchmark performance**: DuckDB ranked #1 on the Pollock benchmark for CSV parsing, correctly reading 99.61% of data across problematic test files\n\n**When CSV makes sense**: Universal compatibility, easy to edit/read, and still common for data exchange from CRMs, social media exports, and financial systems.\n\n## 3. JSON Files\n\nJSON is supported but less efficient than columnar formats:\n\n- **Auto-detection**: `read_json_auto` infers schema, representing nested objects as `STRUCT`s and arrays as `LIST`s\n- **Nested data support**: Use `unnest` function and dot notation to access nested values\n- **Direct API queries**: Can parse JSON directly from web APIs\n- **Best for**: Semi-structured data with varying schemas, API responses, and log files\n\n## Efficiency Comparison Summary\n\n| Format | Compression | Query Performance | Best Use Case |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Parquet** | Excellent (columnar) | Fastest (column pruning, predicate pushdown) | Analytics, large datasets, cloud storage |\n| **CSV** | None | Good with auto-detection | Data exchange, quick imports, universal compatibility |\n| **JSON** | None | Moderate (nested parsing overhead) | Semi-structured data, API data, logs |\n\n## Additional Table Formats\n\nFor advanced use cases, MotherDuck also supports:\n\n- **Apache Iceberg**: Provides transactional guarantees, time travel, and schema evolution on top of Parquet files\n- **Delta Lake**: Similar to Iceberg with ACID transactions and data versioning\n- **DuckLake**: MotherDuck's native table format with modern architecture\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\n1. **Convert CSV to Parquet** when possible for repeated analytical queries - DuckDB makes this trivial with `COPY TO` statements\n2. **Use glob patterns** to query multiple files as a single table: `read_parquet('s3://bucket/**/*.parquet')`\n3. **Leverage Hive-style partitioning** (e.g., `/year=2025/month=10/`) to enable partition pruning and reduce scan costs\n4. **For cloud storage**: Parquet's compression and columnar design significantly reduces network transfer costs\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/why-choose-parquet-table-file-format.md - Comprehensive guide on Parquet format benefits, columnar storage advantages, compression techniques, and DuckDB integration\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/csv-files-persist-duckdb-solution.md - Details on DuckDB's CSV parser capabilities, loading multiple CSVs, and practical examples with Stack Overflow data\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/no-etl-query-raw-files.md - No-ETL approach for querying CSV, JSON, and Parquet files directly; glob patterns; handling messy data; cloud storage integration\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/columnar-storage-guide.md - In-depth explanation of columnar vs row-oriented storage, compression methods, vectorized execution, and Parquet as the standard format\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/taming-wild-csvs-with-duckdb-data-engineering.md - Advanced CSV handling techniques including sniff_csv, error handling options, union_by_name for inconsistent schemas, and Pollock benchmark results\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/analyze-json-data-using-sql.md - Guide on querying JSON files with DuckDB, handling nested data, using unnest function, and importing JSON into tables\n"

              "content": "# Answer\n\nMotherDuck integrates with DuckDB through a sophisticated architecture that extends DuckDB's capabilities without forking the open-source project. Here's how the integration works:\n\n## Extension-Based Integration\n\nMotherDuck uses DuckDB's powerful **extension system** to add cloud capabilities at multiple layers, including the SQL parser, optimizer, and storage interface. The MotherDuck extension is built directly into DuckDB and allows users to connect their local DuckDB instance to the MotherDuck cloud service with a simple `ATTACH` command. This approach means users automatically benefit from the rapid innovation of the DuckDB community almost immediately.\n\n## Three-Layer Architecture\n\nThe integration is built on three main components:\n\n1. **The Client Extension**: This is how MotherDuck integrates with the DuckDB ecosystem. Whether a user is working in the CLI, a Python script, or a JDBC connection, a simple command connects their local DuckDB instance to the MotherDuck cloud. This extension even enables running DuckDB in the browser via WASM for the MotherDuck UI.\n\n2. **The Compute Layer**: In the cloud, queries are processed by containerized DuckDB instances (called \"ducklings\"). These compute resources scale based on user needs, providing necessary CPU and memory for complex analytical queries.\n\n3. **The Storage Layer**: MotherDuck implemented a differential storage system that maps a logical database file to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage. This enables features like database sharing and time travel.\n\n## Dual Execution Model\n\nThe most innovative feature is **dual execution** (also called hybrid execution). This is a hybrid query execution strategy where the optimizer intelligently decides whether to run parts of a query locally on the client or remotely in the MotherDuck cloud. The primary goal is to minimize data movement and leverage compute where it makes the most sense.\n\nFor example, when a query joins local data with cloud data:\n- Local files are scanned and processed on the user's machine\n- Cloud tables are scanned remotely on MotherDuck's compute\n- The system efficiently transfers only the necessary intermediate data to complete the join\n- Users can override execution location with the `md_run` parameter (`'local'` or `'remote'`)\n\n## Key Benefits of the Integration\n\n- **Seamless Connection**: Any DuckDB instance running in Python or CLI can connect to MotherDuck with a single line of code\n- **Same Engine**: MotherDuck uses the exact same DuckDB engine both locally and in the cloud, ensuring query consistency\n- **Database Sharing**: Teams can share databases and collaborate on a single source of truth\n- **Centralized Secret Manager**: Secure credential management for accessing external data sources like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Delta Lake\n- **Browser-Based Access**: DuckDB runs via WASM in the MotherDuck web UI, enabling client-side processing\n\n## Symbiotic Relationship\n\nMotherDuck is the largest production user of DuckDB and continuously pushes the engine to its limits, uncovering opportunities for improvement and contributing enhancements back to the open-source project. This collaboration ensures both DuckDB and MotherDuck continue to evolve together.\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/videos/bringing-duckdb-to-the-cloud-dual-execution-explained.md - Detailed explanation of dual execution architecture, three-layer system (client extension, compute layer, storage layer), and how MotherDuck extends DuckDB without forking\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/what-is-duckdb.md - Background on DuckDB as an embeddable OLAP database and its relationship to MotherDuck as a cloud data warehouse built on DuckDB\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/blog/announcing-motherduck-duckdb-in-the-cloud.md - Announcement of hybrid execution capabilities, showing how local and cloud data can be joined in a single query\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/hybrid-analytics-guide.md - Comprehensive guide on dual execution, how it minimizes data transfer, and the benefits for data engineers\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/glossary/MotherDuck extension.md - Description of the MotherDuck extension that enables seamless integration between local DuckDB and MotherDuck cloud service\n"

              "content": "# Answer\n\nBased on the MotherDuck documentation, there are several SQL features from DuckDB that are not yet supported in MotherDuck:\n\n## 1. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)\n\nCustom Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) **do not work on MotherDuck**. The documentation explicitly states: \"UDFs, as described in this section, are a feature of the local, embedded DuckDB Python library and **do not work on MotherDuck**. The reason is that UDFs require a Python runtime to execute the function's code. MotherDuck is a serverless platform that provides SQL execution but does not run user-provided Python code on its servers.\"\n\nThis means that while you can create and use Python UDFs when running DuckDB locally (using `con.create_function()`), these functions cannot be executed on MotherDuck's cloud infrastructure.\n\n## 2. Server-Side ATTACH to External Databases\n\nMotherDuck does not yet support server-side `ATTACH` to other databases like PostgreSQL. This means you cannot directly connect to external database systems from within MotherDuck's cloud environment.\n\n## 3. Custom Extensions\n\nCustom DuckDB extensions are not yet available on MotherDuck. While DuckDB has a rich extension ecosystem that allows adding capabilities at multiple layers (SQL parser, optimizer, storage interface), custom or third-party extensions cannot be installed on MotherDuck's serverless platform.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThe documentation suggests a common workaround for these limitations: \"perform these specific transformations upstream before loading data into MotherDuck.\" This means handling UDF-based transformations, external database connections, and extension-dependent operations in your local DuckDB environment or ETL pipeline before loading the processed data into MotherDuck.\n\n## Additional DuckDB Limitations (Present in Both DuckDB and MotherDuck)\n\nIt's worth noting that some SQL features are not supported in DuckDB itself (and therefore also unavailable in MotherDuck):\n\n- **ALTER TABLE limitations**: DuckDB does not support `ADD CONSTRAINT` and `DROP CONSTRAINT` in `ALTER TABLE` statements. Constraints must be defined during initial table creation.\n- **ALTER TABLE column type changes**: Unlike PostgreSQL, DuckDB's `ALTER TABLE` doesn't support changing column data types, adding or removing constraints, or modifying default values of existing columns directly.\n- **SERIAL/AUTO_INCREMENT**: DuckDB does not support the `SERIAL` type or simple `AUTOINCREMENT` keywords. Instead, you must use sequences with `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `DEFAULT nextval('sequence_name')`.\n\n## Sources\n\nList each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/fix-slow-bi-dashboards.md - Key information about MotherDuck limitations including: custom Python/native UDFs not supported, server-side ATTACH to other databases not available, and custom extensions not yet available\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/duckdb-python-quickstart-part2.md - Detailed explanation that Python UDFs are a feature of local DuckDB only and \"do not work on MotherDuck\" because MotherDuck is a serverless platform that doesn't run user-provided Python code\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/glossary/ALTER TABLE statement.md - Information about DuckDB's limited ALTER TABLE functionality compared to PostgreSQL (no support for changing column data types, adding/removing constraints)\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/acid-transactions-sql.md - Confirmation that DuckDB does not support ADD CONSTRAINT and DROP CONSTRAINT in ALTER TABLE statements\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/learn-more/star-schema-data-warehouse-guide.md - Information about DuckDB not supporting SERIAL type or AUTOINCREMENT keywords, requiring sequences instead\n- .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/videos/bringing-duckdb-to-the-cloud-dual-execution-explained.md - Background on MotherDuck's architecture and extension system\n"
