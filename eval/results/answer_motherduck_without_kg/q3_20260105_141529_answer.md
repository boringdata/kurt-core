# Answer

Based on the MotherDuck documentation, there are several SQL features from DuckDB that are not yet supported in MotherDuck:

## 1. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

Custom Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) **do not work on MotherDuck**. The documentation explicitly states: "UDFs, as described in this section, are a feature of the local, embedded DuckDB Python library and **do not work on MotherDuck**. The reason is that UDFs require a Python runtime to execute the function's code. MotherDuck is a serverless platform that provides SQL execution but does not run user-provided Python code on its servers."

This means that while you can create and use Python UDFs when running DuckDB locally (using `con.create_function()`), these functions cannot be executed on MotherDuck's cloud infrastructure.

## 2. Server-Side ATTACH to External Databases

MotherDuck does not yet support server-side `ATTACH` to other databases like PostgreSQL. This means you cannot directly connect to external database systems from within MotherDuck's cloud environment.

## 3. Custom Extensions

Custom DuckDB extensions are not yet available on MotherDuck. While DuckDB has a rich extension ecosystem that allows adding capabilities at multiple layers (SQL parser, optimizer, storage interface), custom or third-party extensions cannot be installed on MotherDuck's serverless platform.

## Workarounds

The documentation suggests a common workaround for these limitations: "perform these specific transformations upstream before loading data into MotherDuck." This means handling UDF-based transformations, external database connections, and extension-dependent operations in your local DuckDB environment or ETL pipeline before loading the processed data into MotherDuck.

## Additional DuckDB Limitations (Present in Both DuckDB and MotherDuck)

It's worth noting that some SQL features are not supported in DuckDB itself (and therefore also unavailable in MotherDuck):

- **ALTER TABLE limitations**: DuckDB does not support `ADD CONSTRAINT` and `DROP CONSTRAINT` in `ALTER TABLE` statements. Constraints must be defined during initial table creation.
- **ALTER TABLE column type changes**: Unlike PostgreSQL, DuckDB's `ALTER TABLE` doesn't support changing column data types, adding or removing constraints, or modifying default values of existing columns directly.
- **SERIAL/AUTO_INCREMENT**: DuckDB does not support the `SERIAL` type or simple `AUTOINCREMENT` keywords. Instead, you must use sequences with `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `DEFAULT nextval('sequence_name')`.
