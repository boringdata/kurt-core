# Answer

Migrating data from a local DuckDB database to MotherDuck is a straightforward process thanks to the seamless integration between DuckDB and MotherDuck. Here's how to do it:

## Method 1: Using the ATTACH Command (Recommended)

The simplest way to connect your local DuckDB to MotherDuck and migrate data is using the `ATTACH` command:

1. **Connect to MotherDuck**: From your local DuckDB CLI or Python environment, run:
   ```sql
   ATTACH 'md:';
   ```
   This single command connects your local DuckDB instance to MotherDuck. Authentication requires a MotherDuck token, which can be set as an environment variable.

2. **Create a database in MotherDuck**: Once connected, you can create a new database in the cloud:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE my_cloud_database;
   ```

3. **Copy tables from local to cloud**: Use `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` to copy your local data to MotherDuck:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE md:my_cloud_database.my_table AS
   SELECT * FROM local_database.my_table;
   ```

## Method 2: Upload Files via MotherDuck Web UI

MotherDuck provides a notebook-like web interface where you can:
- Upload local CSV and Parquet files directly
- Analyze and manage them alongside your other MotherDuck data
- Use DuckDB-WASM in-browser for immediate data exploration

## Method 3: From Local Files (CSV, Parquet)

If your data is in file format, you can create tables directly in MotherDuck:

```sql
-- Connect to MotherDuck
ATTACH 'md:';

-- Create table from local file
CREATE TABLE md:my_database.my_table AS
SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('path/to/your/file.csv');

-- Or from Parquet
CREATE TABLE md:my_database.my_table AS
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('path/to/your/file.parquet');
```

## Key Concepts

### Dual Execution
When connected to MotherDuck, queries can leverage **dual execution** - an intelligent hybrid query execution strategy where the optimizer determines whether to run parts of a query locally or in the cloud. This minimizes data movement and leverages compute where it makes the most sense.

### Hybrid Workflow
MotherDuck creates a "multiplayer" experience from DuckDB's traditionally single-player architecture:
- Your laptop and MotherDuck cloud become two nodes in a single distributed system
- Both nodes execute queries in concert, automatically routing parts of queries to the optimal location
- You can even JOIN local data with cloud data in a single query

### No Database Changes Needed
One of the key benefits is that what works locally will work in the cloud - MotherDuck uses the exact same DuckDB engine. Simply add the `md:` prefix to your connection or database references to work with cloud data.

## After Migration

Once your data is in MotherDuck, you can:
- **Share databases** with team members using `CREATE SHARE`
- Use MotherDuck's **Secret Manager** for secure credential management
- Access your data from anywhere using Python, CLI, JDBC, or the web UI
- Take advantage of MotherDuck's serverless infrastructure for scaling
