# Answer

If you have a CSV on your laptop and a table in S3, the most efficient way to join them using MotherDuck is through **Dual Execution** - a hybrid query execution strategy that minimizes data transfer by intelligently pushing computation to where the data lives.

## How It Works

MotherDuck treats your laptop and the MotherDuck cloud as two nodes in a single distributed system. When you run a hybrid query joining local and cloud data, the **Dual Execution query planner** does the following:

1. **Local Scan:** Scans your local CSV file on your laptop
2. **Filter Locally:** Applies any filters to the local data on your machine
3. **Transfer Minimal Data:** Sends only the necessary filtered rows (not the entire file) to the cloud
4. **Join in the Cloud:** Performs the final join against the S3 table in the MotherDuck cloud

This process can reduce network traffic by **orders of magnitude** compared to traditional methods that would require uploading your entire local file or downloading the entire cloud table.

## Practical Example

You can write a single SQL query that seamlessly joins your local CSV with cloud data:

```sql
SELECT
    local_data.*,
    cloud_table.*
FROM read_csv('local_file.csv') AS local_data
JOIN my_database.my_s3_table AS cloud_table
ON local_data.id = cloud_table.id
WHERE local_data.category = 'specific_value';
```

## Verifying Execution Location

You can use an `EXPLAIN` statement to see which parts of the query run locally `(L)` and which run remotely `(R)` - this helps you understand how MotherDuck is optimizing your hybrid query.

## Key Benefits

- **No manual data movement:** No need to upload CSVs or download S3 data first
- **Minimal data transfer:** Only filtered/necessary data crosses the network
- **Single engine semantics:** The same DuckDB engine runs locally and in the cloud, ensuring consistent behavior
- **Cost efficiency:** Leverages your laptop's compute for local processing, reducing cloud costs
