# Why a Query Might Run Slower on MotherDuck Than Locally

There are several reasons why a query might run slower on MotherDuck (or any cloud data warehouse) compared to running it locally with DuckDB:

## 1. Network Latency and Data Transfer Overhead

When running queries in the cloud, data must travel over the network between:
- Your client and the MotherDuck service
- MotherDuck and cloud object storage (like S3)

As the documentation states: "Distributed systems create significant latency due to overhead." Network latency creates a "slow feedback loop" that doesn't exist when processing data locally in memory.

## 2. I/O Bottlenecks from Cloud Object Storage

Reading data from cloud object storage like Amazon S3 is "the slowest part of any query." Locally, data can be read from fast local SSDs or even cached in memory, which is orders of magnitude faster than cloud storage I/O.

The bottleneck hierarchy is:
1. **I/O (storage)** - Reading from cloud object storage is slowest
2. **Network (shuffle)** - Moving data between nodes
3. **CPU (compute)** - Actual processing

## 3. Data Layout Not Optimized for Your Query

If your cloud data isn't properly partitioned or clustered to match your query patterns, the engine must scan far more data than necessary. Locally, with smaller datasets, this overhead is less pronounced.

## 4. When Local is Genuinely Better

For smaller datasets (under 10 TB), cloud overhead can make queries "potentially slower than vanilla DuckDB." Local DuckDB eliminates:
- Network round-trips
- Cloud storage I/O latency
- Serialization overhead

## Mitigation: Dual Execution Model

MotherDuck's dual execution model is designed to address this by intelligently minimizing data transfer and allowing queries to leverage both local compute and cloud resources. This "reduces network traffic by orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods."

For interactive development, consider using DuckDB locally and MotherDuck for production workloads that benefit from cloud scalability.
