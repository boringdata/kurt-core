# SQL Features from DuckDB Not Yet Supported in MotherDuck

Based on the MotherDuck documentation, the following DuckDB SQL features have limitations when used in MotherDuck:

## 1. Excel Extension File Imports via UI

**Limitation:** The MotherDuck UI does not allow importing of Excel extension files. Users must use the DuckDB CLI to accomplish Excel file integration.

From the source documentation:
> "It should be noted that as of this writing, the MotherDuck UI does not allow importing of Excel extension files, so you need to use the DuckDB CLI to accomplish this integration. While this is fine for data pipeline work, it is fairly annoying for ad-hoc data exploration; we are aware of this and working on it."

**Workaround:** Use the DuckDB CLI to load Excel files into MotherDuck:
```sql
-- attach motherduck so you can see your cloud databases
ATTACH 'md:';

-- add the data to motherduck
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE my_db.my_table AS
  FROM read_xlsx(
  'my_excel_file.xlsx',
  all_varchar = true,
  sheet = 'sheet2');
```

## Summary

The primary documented limitation between DuckDB and MotherDuck is the inability to import Excel extension files through the MotherDuck web UI. The MotherDuck team has acknowledged this limitation and is working on addressing it. For now, users can work around this by using the DuckDB CLI to handle Excel file operations before syncing data to MotherDuck.

Note: MotherDuck and DuckDB share core SQL compatibility, and MotherDuck's dual execution model allows most DuckDB SQL features to work seamlessly across local and cloud environments.
