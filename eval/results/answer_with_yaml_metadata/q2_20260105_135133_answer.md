# How MotherDuck Integrates with DuckDB

MotherDuck is a modern cloud data warehouse **built on DuckDB**, extending DuckDB's capabilities without forking the open source project. This creates a hybrid system that intelligently balances local and cloud computing.

## Integration Architecture

MotherDuck integrates with DuckDB through three key components:

### 1. Client Extension
- Uses DuckDB's powerful **extension system** to add capabilities at multiple layers (SQL parser, optimizer, storage interface)
- A simple `ATTACH` command connects any local DuckDB instance (CLI, Python, JDBC) to MotherDuck cloud
- Also runs DuckDB in the browser via WASM for the MotherDuck UI

### 2. Compute Layer
- Cloud queries processed by containerized DuckDB instances called "ducklings"
- Resources scale based on user needs

### 3. Storage Layer
- Implements a differential storage system mapping logical database files to append-only snapshot layers in cloud object storage
- Enables concurrent multi-user read/write access (unlike DuckDB's local single-writer model)

## Dual Execution: The Core Innovation

The most distinctive integration feature is **dual execution**, a hybrid query execution strategy where:

- The optimizer intelligently decides whether to run parts of a query **locally on the client** or **remotely in the MotherDuck cloud**
- Your laptop and MotherDuck cloud are treated as **two nodes in a single distributed system**
- The same DuckDB engine runs both locally and in the cloud, guaranteeing consistent behavior

### How Dual Execution Works

When joining local and cloud data:

1. **Local Scan**: Scans local files (CSV, Parquet) on your laptop
2. **Filter Locally**: Applies filters on your machine
3. **Transfer Minimal Data**: Sends only filtered/necessary data to cloud
4. **Join in Cloud**: Performs final operations against cloud data

This reduces network traffic by **orders of magnitude** compared to traditional methods.

### Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Zero-latency local iteration before scaling to cloud
- **Lower Costs**: Leverages free local compute and minimizes data transfer
- **Better Collaboration**: Transforms "single-player" DuckDB into a "multiplayer" platform with database sharing

## Staying Current

Because MotherDuck uses extensions rather than forking DuckDB, users benefit from rapid DuckDB community innovation almost immediately. MotherDuck, as the largest production user of DuckDB, also contributes improvements back to the open source project.
