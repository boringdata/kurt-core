# How to Migrate Data from Local DuckDB to MotherDuck

Migrating data from a local DuckDB database to MotherDuck is straightforward using the `ATTACH` command and standard SQL statements.

## Basic Migration Steps

### 1. Connect to MotherDuck

From your local DuckDB CLI or Python session, connect to MotherDuck with a single command:

```sql
ATTACH 'md:';
```

Authentication requires a MotherDuck token, which can be set as an environment variable (`MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`).

### 2. Create a Cloud Database (if needed)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE md:my_cloud_db;
```

### 3. Copy Tables to MotherDuck

Use `CREATE TABLE AS` to copy local tables to MotherDuck:

```sql
-- Copy a local table to a MotherDuck database
CREATE TABLE md:my_cloud_db.my_table AS
SELECT * FROM local_database.my_table;
```

Or use the `COPY` command for more control:

```sql
COPY local_table TO 'md:my_cloud_db.my_table';
```

### 4. Verify the Migration

After copying, you can query your data in the cloud:

```sql
SELECT * FROM md:my_cloud_db.my_table LIMIT 10;
```

## Key Points

- **Seamless Integration**: Once you run `ATTACH 'md:'`, your local DuckDB instance becomes "MotherDuck-supercharged" with access to both local and cloud data
- **Dual Execution**: MotherDuck intelligently determines whether to run computations locally or in the cloud based on data location
- **Simple Authentication**: Just set your MotherDuck token as an environment variable
- **Standard SQL**: Pushing data from local to remote uses familiar SQL commands like `CREATE TABLE AS` and `COPY`
