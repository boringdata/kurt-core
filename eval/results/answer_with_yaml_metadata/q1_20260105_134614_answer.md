# Most Efficient File Formats for Loading Data into MotherDuck

**Parquet is the most efficient file format for loading data into MotherDuck.**

## Why Parquet is Most Efficient

1. **Columnar Storage**: Unlike row-based formats like CSV, Parquet stores data by columns, enabling faster query performance and superior compression for large-scale analytical workloads.

2. **Efficient Compression and Encoding**: Parquet leverages specialized encoding techniques such as dictionary, run-length, and delta encoding to optimize storage. These methods reduce the data footprint, translating into cost savings and improved access speeds.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Parquet supports techniques like predicate pushdown and column pruning, which bring filtering and aggregation operations closer to the storage layer. This reduces the amount of data that needs processing, speeds up queries, and lowers computational demands.

4. **Schema Evolution**: Parquet handles evolving data structures with ease, supporting seamless schema modifications without disrupting existing workflows.

## Format Comparison

| Format | Type | Efficiency for Analytics |
|--------|------|-------------------------|
| **Parquet** | Columnar | Highest - optimized for analytical queries |
| Apache ORC | Columnar | High - good compression, Hadoop-optimized |
| CSV | Row-based | Low - no compression, no schema management |
| Apache Avro | Row-based | Medium - better for streaming/serialization |

## Recommendation

For loading data into MotherDuck, **convert data to Parquet format** before loading whenever possible. This provides the best performance for analytical workloads due to columnar storage, efficient compression, and query optimization features.
