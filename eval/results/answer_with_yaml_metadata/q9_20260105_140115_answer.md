# MotherDuck Compute Instance Sizes

MotherDuck offers **four compute instance sizes** (called "ducklings"):

1. **Standard** - Default instance size for most users
2. **Jumbo** - Larger instance, sufficient for the vast majority of customers
3. **Mega** - For demanding workloads at larger scale
4. **Giga** - Largest instances for the toughest transformations

## Instance Size Details

### Mega Ducklings
- Designed for when workloads have outgrown Jumbo
- Unlocks more in-memory execution
- Handles larger joins and aggregations without spilling
- **Use cases:**
  - Queries too complex or data volume too high for Jumbo
  - Weekly jobs that rebuild tables and need to run in minutes, not hours
  - Customers with 10x the data who need subsecond response times
- **Availability:** Self-serve on the Business Plan

### Giga Ducklings
- Largest instance sizes available
- Purpose-built for the toughest of transformations
- Provides maximum compute and memory environment
- **Use cases:**
  - Data workloads so complex or massive that nothing else will work
  - One-time jobs like restating 10 years of revenue data
  - Growth path beyond Mega when data volume/complexity grows 10x
  - Very complex joins, deeply nested CTEs, long-range analytical backfills
- **Availability:** Available on request through Business Plan (contact sales)

## Architecture Note

MotherDuck uses a **per-user tenancy** model where each user gets their own configurable duckling. This allows mixing instance sizes - for example, using Mega for complex data pipeline transformations while using Standard instances to serve most users. Each instance is provisioned on demand and fully managed.
