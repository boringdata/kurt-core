# What DuckDB Versions Does MotherDuck Currently Support?

**MotherDuck currently supports DuckDB version 1.4.1.**

As of October 2025, MotherDuck upgraded to support DuckDB 1.4.1, which builds on the foundation of DuckDB 1.4.0 with important bugfixes and additional improvements.

## Key Points

1. **Single Version Support**: MotherDuck supports only one version of DuckDB at a time. Users are encouraged to upgrade their local DuckDB clients to match MotherDuck's supported version.

2. **DuckDB 1.4.x Features**: The 1.4.0 release introduced landmark features including:
   - MERGE statement
   - VARIANT type
   - Completely rewritten sorting engine
   - Database encryption using AES-256-GCM

3. **DuckLake Support**: Alongside DuckDB 1.4.1, MotherDuck now supports DuckLake version 0.3, which includes:
   - Iceberg interoperability
   - CHECKPOINT function for automatic table maintenance
   - Native support for spatial geometry types
   - Full MERGE INTO statement support

4. **Long Term Support (LTS)**: DuckDB has established its first Long Term Support model with one year of community support, starting with version 1.4.0.

## Recommendation

While users can continue using their current version of DuckDB, MotherDuck encourages upgrading DuckDB clients to 1.4.1 as soon as possible to ensure compatibility.
