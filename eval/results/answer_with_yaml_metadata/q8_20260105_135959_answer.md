# Difference Between a MotherDuck Database and a Share

## Database

A **database** in MotherDuck is your primary data storage unit where you create, modify, and manage your data. Databases are:

- **Read-write**: You can perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Owned by you**: Full control over the data and schema
- **Attachable**: Can be connected to DuckDB sessions for querying
- **Persistent**: Stores your data in the MotherDuck cloud

## Share

A **share** is a read-only view of a database designed specifically for data collaboration. Shares are:

- **Read-only**: Purpose-built for data collaboration and ad-hoc analytics - users can query but not modify the data
- **Zero-copy clones**: Allow users to access the same dataset without duplicating data, meaning no additional storage costs
- **Snapshot-based**: By default, shares capture a point-in-time snapshot of your database
- **Automatically syncable**: With Auto Update enabled, shares can automatically sync with the latest changes within five minutes of any completed writes to the source database

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Database | Share |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Access** | Full read-write | Read-only |
| **Purpose** | Primary data storage and manipulation | Data collaboration and distribution |
| **Data duplication** | Original data | Zero-copy clone (no duplication) |
| **Updates** | Direct modifications | Snapshots; can auto-sync with Auto Update |
| **Use case** | Your working data environment | Sharing data with colleagues or external users |

## When to Use Each

- **Use a database** when you need to store, transform, and manage your data
- **Use a share** when you want to give others access to query your data without giving them write permissions or duplicating the underlying data
