    Answer this question by searching through the .kurt/sources/ directory:

    {question}

    Required Steps:
    1. Search for relevant markdown files in .kurt/sources/ using glob and grep
    2. Read the most relevant files (aim for 3-5 most relevant sources)
    3. As you read each file, keep track of:
       - The file path
       - The file title/name
       - Key information extracted from that file
    4. Synthesize a comprehensive answer based on the information found
    5. Write your answer to: {answer_file}

    IMPORTANT - Your answer MUST have this structure:
    ```markdown
    # Answer

    [Your comprehensive answer here, drawing from the sources you read]

    ## Sources

    List each source file you actually read and used, showing the EXACT LOCAL FILE PATH:
    - .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/[path/to/file.md] - Brief description of key information used from this file
    - .kurt/sources/motherduck.com/[path/to/file.md] - Brief description of key information used from this file
    [etc.]

    DO NOT use URLs or document titles as links. Show the actual file path you read with the Read tool.
    ```

    The Sources section is MANDATORY - you must list every file you read to answer the question.

  assertions:
    - type: FileExists
      path: "{answer_file}"
