# Cloudflare Pages

Create full-stack applications that are instantly deployed to the Cloudflare global network.

Deploy your Pages project by connecting to [your Git provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/), uploading prebuilt assets directly to Pages with [Direct Upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/) or using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) from the command line.

### Pages Functions

Use Pages Functions to deploy server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server.

### Rollbacks

Rollbacks allow you to instantly revert your project to a previous production deployment.

### Redirects

Set up redirects for your Cloudflare Pages project.
