# Vercel Documentation

Vercel is the AI Cloud for building and deploying modern web applications, from static sites to AI-powered agents.

You can build and host many different types of applications on Vercel, static sites with your favorite [framework](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks), [multi-tenant](https://vercel.com/docs/multi-tenant) applications, or [microfrontends](https://vercel.com/docs/microfrontends), to [AI-powered agents](https://vercel.com/kb/guide/how-to-build-ai-agents-with-vercel-and-the-ai-sdk).

You can also use the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations) to find and install integrations such as AI providers, databases, CMSs, analytics, storage, and more.

When you are ready to build, connect your [Git repository](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to deploy on every push, with [automatic preview environments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production) for testing changes before production.

See the [getting started guide](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel) for more information, or the [incremental migration guide](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-migration) for a step-by-step guide to migrating your existing application to Vercel.
