You can use GitHub's API to build scripts and applications that automate processes, integrate with GitHub, and extend GitHub. For example, you could use the API to triage issues, build an analytics dashboard, or manage releases.

Each REST API endpoint is documented individually, and the endpoints are categorized by the resource that they primarily affect. For example, you can find endpoints relating to issues in [REST API endpoints for issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues).

[Getting started with the REST API](https://docs.github.com#getting-started-with-the-rest-api)

**If you are new to REST APIs**, you may find it helpful to refer to the Quickstart or Getting Started guide for an introduction. For more information, see:

**If you are familiar with REST APIs** but new to GitHub's REST API, you may find it helpful to refer to the authentication documentation. For more information, see:

**If you are building scripts or applications** that use the REST API, you may find some of the following guides helpful. For examples of scripting with the REST API, see:

[Scripting with the REST API and JavaScript](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/scripting-with-the-rest-api-and-javascript)[Scripting with the REST API and Ruby](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/scripting-with-the-rest-api-and-ruby)[Building a GitHub App that responds to webhook events](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/writing-code-for-a-github-app/building-a-github-app-that-responds-to-webhook-events)[Building a CLI with a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/writing-code-for-a-github-app/building-a-cli-with-a-github-app)[Automatically redelivering failed deliveries for a repository webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/automatically-redelivering-failed-deliveries-for-a-repository-webhook)

For a list of libraries to facilitate scripting with the REST API, see [Libraries for the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/libraries-for-the-rest-api).

If you are building scripts or applications that use the REST API, you might also be interested in using webhooks to get notified about events or a GitHub App to access resources on behalf of a user or in an organization. For more information, see [About webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/about-webhooks) and [Deciding when to build a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/deciding-when-to-build-a-github-app).
