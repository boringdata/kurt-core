# BELIEFS

Core operating principles for this repo.

## Mission

Ship correct, verifiable changes with minimal risk.

## Priorities (In Order)

1. Correctness and safety
2. Traceability (issues, commits, evidence)
3. Small, reviewable changes
4. Speed (only after the above)

## Principles

- Prefer boring, proven approaches over clever ones.
- Every change should be independently verifiable.
- Evidence is not optional; if you can't prove it, it didn't happen.
- Plans before code. Specs before plans. Questions before specs.
- Small diffs are easier to review, easier to revert, easier to understand.
