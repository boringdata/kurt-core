# Plan: <title>

Status: idea | draft | refined | decomposed | completed
Owner: <name>
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Goal

## Non-goals

## Assumptions

## Open questions

Mark unresolved blockers with `BLOCKING`.

## System contracts (MUST)

- Interfaces (routes/CLI/schemas):
- Error/failure behavior:
- Security invariants (if relevant):

## Phases + Gates

For each phase:
- What
- Files
- Gate (exact commands + pass criteria)

## Validation gate (draft -> refined)

Plan is refined only if:
- Non-goals exist (>= 3 bullets)
- Open questions resolved or marked BLOCKING
- System contracts exist (interfaces + failure behavior)
- Each phase has at least one gate command

## Decomposition (refined -> decomposed)

Converted into beads:
- beads_epic_id: `<br-xxx>`
- beads: `[br-xxx.1, br-xxx.2, ...]`

## Evidence

Evidence lives in `.agent-evidence/` (not committed).
When closing: include PR/commit links, evidence pointers, ADR/runbook updates.
