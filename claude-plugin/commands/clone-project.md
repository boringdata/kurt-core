# Clone Project

This command clones a built-in template OR an existing project and guides you through customizing it.

Invoke the `kurt:project-management-skill` and execute the **clone-project** operation following the instructions in the SKILL.md file.

**Clone from built-in templates:**
- **weekly-tutorial** - Recurring tutorial publication
- **product-launch** - Multi-format product launch campaign
- **tutorial-refresh** - Analytics-driven tutorial updates
- **documentation-audit** - Comprehensive traffic audit
- **gap-analysis** - Identify missing content vs competitor
- **competitive-analysis** - Quality benchmark against competitor

**Clone from your existing projects:**
- Use any project slug from `projects/` directory
- Preserves workflow structure, rules, and methodology
- Resets sources, targets, and progress for new iteration
- Perfect for recurring workflows (e.g., quarterly audits)

The skill will guide you through:
1. Choosing source (template or existing project)
2. Previewing the structure
3. Naming the new project and customizing goal
4. Customizing sections (sources, targets, etc.)
5. Creating the new project structure
