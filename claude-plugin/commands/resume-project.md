# Resume Kurt Project

This command resumes work on an existing Kurt project.

Invoke the `kurt:project-management-skill` and execute the **resume-project** operation following the instructions in the SKILL.md file.

The skill will guide you through:
1. Loading project context from project.md
2. Checking organizational onboarding (content map + core rules)
3. Checking project-specific content status (sources, targets, rules)
4. Analyzing gaps and recommending next steps
5. Validating rule coverage before content work
