# Update Profile: Selective Profile Updates

This command lets you update specific parts of your existing team profile.

Invoke the `kurt:onboarding-skill` and execute the **update-profile** operation following the instructions in the SKILL.md file.

You can selectively update:
- **Content map** - Add/remove organizational domains
- **Analytics** - Configure or update analytics for domains
- **Foundation rules** - Re-extract with new content
- **Team information** - Update company/team details

**Requires:** Existing profile (run `/create-profile` first if you haven't)

The skill will show you a menu of update options and guide you through the selected changes.
