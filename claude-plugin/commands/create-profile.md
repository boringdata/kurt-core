# Create Profile: Team Onboarding

This command runs the complete team onboarding process.

Invoke the `kurt:onboarding-skill` and execute the **create-profile** operation following the instructions in the SKILL.md file.

The skill will guide you through:
1. Capturing team context (company, goals, content types, personas)
2. Mapping organizational content (website, docs, blog)
3. Setting up analytics (optional, for traffic-based prioritization)
4. Extracting foundation rules (publisher profile, primary voice, personas)
5. Creating your team profile (`.kurt/profile.md`)

**Takes 10-15 minutes.** Required before creating projects.

**If you already have a profile**, use `/update-profile` instead to make selective updates.
